          and Transforms</a></h3>
          <p class="noindent">Lookup tables (LUTs) are a technique
          for optimizing the evaluation of functions that are
          expensive to compute and inexpensive to cache, or for
          sampling process such as printing to film which are not
          definable mathematically. By precomputing the evaluation
          of a function over a domain of common inputs, expensive
          runtime operations can be replaced with inexpensive table
          lookups. If the table lookups can be performed faster
          than computing the results from scratch, then the use of
          a lookup table will yield significant performance gains.
          For input values that fall between the table’s samples,
          an interpolation algorithm can generate reasonable
          approximations by averaging nearby samples. LUTs are also
          useful when wanting to separate the calculation of a
          transform from its application. For example, in color
          pipelines it is often useful to "bake" a series of color
          transforms into a single lookup table, which is then
          suitable for distribution and re-use, even in situations
          where the original data sets are not appropriate for
          distribution.</p>
          <p class="indent">It is important to bear in mind that a
          LUT is a "black box" transforming one set of values into
          a new set of values. A color transform expressed as a LUT
          will be designed for input in a particular color
          encoding, and will produce output which may be in the
          same or a different encoding. If the image data to be
          transformed is not in the correct format for the LUT,
          then it is necessary to first transform it by using a
          mathematical method, or even with another LUT. Most LUT
          formats have no way of defining what their expected input
          is, nor the encoding of their output, so it is useful to
          make this clear either in the naming of the LUT file or
          in a comment line within the LUT.</p>
          <p class="indent">The values listed in the tables can be
          calculated by iterating over the possible input values,
          and applying the required transform mathematically, or by
          creating what is called a CMS (Color Management System)
          pattern image that incorporates all possible input
          values, passing it through the transform as if it was any
          other image, and then reading back the resulting color
          values to create the table. The image is simply a linear
          ramp to generate a 1D LUT, or a grid of all possible
          permutations of RGB, at the chosen LUT intervals, for a
          3D LUT.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">4.4.1</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-37-157" id="x37-1560004.4.1">1D
          LUTs</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">A lookup table is characterized by
          its dimensionality, that is, the number of indices
          necessary to index an output value. The simplest LUTs are
          indexed by a single variable and thus referred to as
          one-dimensional (or 1D) LUTs.</p>
          <p class="indent">These graphs demonstrate simple color
          correction operators suitable for baking into 1D LUT
          representations. Consider an analytical color operator,
          f(x), applied to an 8 bit greyscale image. The naive
          implementation would be to step through the image and for
          each pixel to evaluate the function. However, one may
          observe that no matter how complex the function, it can
          evaluate to only one of 255 output values (corresponding
          to each unique input). Thus, an alternate implementation
          would be to tabulate the function’s result for each
          possible input value, then to transform each pixel at
          runtime by looking up the stored solution. Assuming that
          integer table lookups are efficient (they are), and that
          the rasterized image has more than 255 total pixels (it
          likely does) using a LUT will lead to a significant
          speedup.</p>
          <p class="indent">All color operators that operate on
          channels independently can be accelerated using 1D LUTs,
          including the brightness, gamma, and contrast operators.
          By assigning a 1D LUT to each color channel individually,
          it is possible to implement more sophisticated operations
          such as color balancing. For those familiar with the
          Photoshop, all Curves and Levels operations can be
          accelerated with 1D LUTs.</p>
          <p class="indent">Unfortunately, many useful color
          operators do not operate on channels independently and
          are thus impossible to implement using a
          single-dimensional LUT. For example, consider the
          luminance operator that converts colored pixels into
          their greyscale equivalent. Because each output value is
          derived as a weighted average of the input channels, it
          is not possible to express such an operator using a 1D
          LUT. All other operators that rely on such channel
          crosstalk are equally inexpressible. Likewise for
          transforms derived from sampling complex non-linear
          processes such as film print emulation.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">4.4.2</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-37-158" id="x37-1570004.4.2">3D
          LUTs</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Three-dimensional lookup tables offer
          the obvious solution to the inherent limitation of
          single-dimensional LUTs, allowing tabular data indexed on
          three independent parameters. Whereas a 1D LUT requires
          only 4 elements to sample 4 locations in an input range,
          the corresponding 3D LUT requires 43 = 64 elements.
          Beware of this added dimensionality; 3D LUTs grow very
          quickly as a function of their linear sampling rate, as
          does the processing power required, particularly in
          real-time systems. As a direct implication of smaller LUT
          sizes, high-quality interpolation takes on a greater
          significance for 3D LUTs. The two most commonly used
          interpolation methods are tri-linear and tetrahedral.</p>
          <p class="indent">Complex color operators can be
          expressed using 3D LUTs, as completely arbitrary
          input-output mappings are allowed. For this reason, 3D
          LUTs have long been embraced by color scientists and are
          one of the tools commonly used for gamut mapping. In
          fact, 3D LUTs are used within ICC profiles to model the
          complex device behaviors necessary for accurate color
          image reproduction.</p>
          <p class="indent">The majority of color operators are
          expressible using 3D LUTs. Simple operators (such as
          gamma, brightness, and contrast) are trivial to encode.
          More complex transforms, such as hue and saturation
          modifications, are also possible. Most important, the
          color operations typical of professional color-grading
          systems are expressible (such as the independent warping
          of user-specified sections of the color gamut).</p>
          <p class="indent">Unfortunately, in real-world scenarios,
          not all color transforms are definable as direct
          input-output mappings. In the general case, 3D LUTs can
          express only those transforms that obey the following
          characteristics:</p>
          <p class="indent">A pixel’s computation must be
          independent of the spatial image position. Color
          operators that are influenced by neighboring values, such
          as Bayesian-matting in Chuang et al. (2001) or classical
          garbage masks in Brinkman (1999), are not expressible in
          lookup-table form. The color transform must be reasonably
          continuous, as sparsely sampled data sets are ill-suited
          to represent discontinuous transformations. If smoothly
          interpolating over the sampled transform grid yields
          unacceptable results, lookup tables are not the
          appropriate acceleration technique.</p>
          <p class="indent">Careful attention must be paid when
          crafting 3D LUTs due to a large number of degrees of
          freedom offered. It is all too easy to create a transform
          that yields pleasing results on some subset of source
          imagery, but then reveals discontinuities when applied to
          alternative imagery. Both directly visualizing the 3D
          lattice and running image gradients through the color
          processing allow such discontinuities to be discovered
          ahead of time.</p>
          <p class="indent">The input color space must lie within a
          well-defined domain. An analytically defined brightness
          operator can generate valid results over the entire
          domain of real numbers. However, that same operator baked
          into a lookup table will be valid over only a limited
          domain (for example, perhaps only in the range 0-1).</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">4.4.3</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-37-159" id="x37-1580004.4.3">Using
          Shaper LUTs</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">All lookup tables are a sampling of
          some underlying function, whether that function is
          explicitly known or not. For example, the function f(x) =
          1 / (1 + e-1.5x) is a mathematical function that can be
          evaluated for any input values of x. The function can
          also be represented using a small lookup table over a
          particular domain by evaluating the function at various
          intervals. Table x shows a small lookup table with 5
          samples representing the function over the input range of
          -5 to 5. Input Output -5.00 0.001 -2.50 0.023 0.00 0.500
          2.50 0.977 5.00 0.999</p>
          <p class="indent">When plotting the table values as in
          Figure X one can see the sample point output values in
          the lookup table correspond exactly to the output values
          of the underlying function. The limitation of lookup
          tables, however, is that values between the sample points
          must be interpolated from values within the table.</p>
          <p class="indent">Figure X shows the results of using
          linear interpolation to determine the output values
          between the sample points. The figure illustrates how if
          care is not taken in choosing the location of the samples
          it can lead to a substantial error between the output of
          the lookup table and the result that would have been
          obtained using the underlying function the table was
          intended to model. This is particularly true in where the
          underlying function exhibits a high degree of curvature
          between the samples. Another limitation of lookup tables
          is that the output for values outside the input range
          (e.g. -5 to 5) used to build the lookup table are
          undefined.</p>
          <p class="indent">When building lookup tables, care
          should be taken to choose optimal locations for the table
          samples to minimize the error associated with the
          interpolation. Figure X shows an example of a table with
          optimal, non-uniform set of sample points. It should be
          noted that only a few lookup table formats (e.g. Academy
          CLF and Cinespace) support non-uniform sampling but the
          example below shows how the error can be minimized when
          sample points are chosen with respect to the function
          they are intended emulate.</p>
          <p class="indent">In the example above, the node
          placement is optimized to minimize error uniformly across
          the entire domain. Depending on exactly what the values
          on the x-axis and y-axis of the graph represent, it may
          not yield the best results to minimize error in this
          fashion. Often in VFX and HDR workflows, due to the
          nature of the human visual system, it’s more visually
          appealing to minimize the error in a visually uniform
          space. A quick and dirty way to do this is to
          logarithmically distribute the sample points. This will
          shift the largest errors to the brighter parts of the
          pictures where the eye is less capable of discerning the
          error. Figure X shows the function and logarithmically
          distributed point sampling.</p>
          <p class="indent">The concept of optimal placement of
          sample points can be extended to 3D LUTs where it is
          common to wrap a 3D LUT in a matched set of 1D ’shaper’
          LUTs. Say the ceiling is set at a pixel value of 100.0.
          Dividing this into equally sampled regions for a 32x32x32
          LUT yields a cell size of about 3. Assuming a reasonable
          exposure transform, almost all perceptually significant
          results are going to be compressed into the few lowest
          cells, wasting the majority of the data set and using
          potentially inaccurate interpolation over the large steps
          in those lowest cells. It is preferable to place the
          samples in the most visually significant locations, which
          typically occur closer to the dark end of the gamut. This
          is achieved by wrapping the 3D lookup-table transform
          with a matched pair of 1D shaper LUTs. The ideal shaper
          LUT maps the input HDR color space to a normalized,
          perceptually uniform color space. The 3D LUT is then
          applied. After the 3D transform the image may be mapped
          through a further 1D transform, such as the inverse of
          the original 1D LUT, mapping the pixel data back into the
          original dynamic range.</p>
          <p class="indent">This second shaper is only necessary
          for transforms such as those from linear to linear. If
          the transform is linear to log, or linear to ‘video’,
          only an input shaper is normally needed. Shaper LUTs may
          be separate files, applied sequentially with the 3D LUT,
          or may be included in a single 1D+3D combined LUT.</p>

          <p class="noindent">An additional LUT technique that is
          becoming more widely available is the Half Float LUT.
          There are only 65536 possible 16 bit half floating-point
          values. As such, it is possible to apply a function to
          each of these values in sequence and record the results
          in a LUT. The value used for indexing into the table is
          not the floating-point value, as that is practically
          unbounded and would pose interpolation and quantization
          issues. Instead, the 16 bit half value is converted to
          its bitwise integer equivalent. This value is then used
          as the index into the table.</p>
          <p class="indent">The 16 bit float value ranges and their
          integer equivalents are as follows: Support for Half
          Float LUTs can be found in the Common LUT Format that is
          part of the ACES specification.</p>

          LUTs</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">LUTs are fundamentally lists of
          output values, corresponding to input values, and most
          LUT formats store these as plain text lists or XML. Some
          binary formats exist, usually for efficiency in hardware
          LUT implementations, and for these, it is often simpler
          to create a human-readable LUT first and then convert
          with suitable utility software to the binary form.</p>
          <p class="indent">for clarity, resulting in 9 ? 9 ? 9 =
          729 different colored patches Grading and compositing
          systems include the functionality to read such images and
          generate LUTs, either from transforms applied by their
          own processes, or externally, in which case the nature of
          the process may be unknown, or even secret.</p>
          <p class="indent">If the transform to be applied is a
          known mathematical one, perhaps a specific color space
          transform, LUTs can be baked using Colour Science for
          Python, for example. A simple code example to do this for
          an unspecified transform where output = f(input) is shown
          below: import colour LUT = colour.LUT3D(name=’LUT Name’)
          LUT.domain = ([[-0.07, -0.07, -0.07], [1.09, 1.09,
          1.09]]) LUT.comments = [’First comment’, ’Second
          comment’] LUT.table = f(LUT.table)</p>
          <p class="indent">This procedure is all that is needed
          when the LUT in question is to be applied to an output
          referred image, or a log image in the 0-1 range. However
          when a shaper is required, to create a LUT for HDR image
          data, the situation is more complex. Decisions need to be
          made, and there is no one correct solution. Sometimes the
          possible range of the input data is known - if it comes
          from a specific camera perhaps - but it is often
          necessary to decide on a sensible input range, and accept
          that data outside this range may be clipped. It is also
          useful to consider what data may be clipped in the final
          output, so as not to waste input range on unnecessary
          values. For example, if baking a LUT to apply the ACES
          RRT plus an SDR ODT to ACES linear data, any shaper which
          includes input values above 16.3 is wasteful, as these
          will be clipped by the ODT. A balance needs to be struck
          between covering a sufficient range, and not spreading
          the available table entries too thinly, which can result
          in distortions from interpolation if the shaper does not
          include enough points for the range. It can be helpful to
          calculate forward and reverse shapers and pass a linear
          ramp through a concatenation of the two, looking for
          deviations from a straight line (particularly near black)
          after the round trip.</p>
          <p class="indent">A linear ramp transformed from ACEScct
          to ACEScg and back using a 12 bit 1D LUT. In the plot
          above, because of the wide range covered by ACEScct, the
          first interval of the linear to log LUT covers the
          ACEScct range 0.0-0.304 (-0.007-0.047 linear).
          Interpolating linearly for values in this large interval,
          when they are in fact logarithmically spaced, results in
          this "kink". For the full range covered by ACEScct, a 16
          bits are needed before the distortion becomes negligible
          with uniformly spaced samples. The alternative is to use
          a non-uniform shaper if the LUT format supports that. The
          OCIO ACES config, for example, takes the latter approach
          by including only log to linear shaper LUTs, and using
          them in the reverse direction for linear to log
          conversions. The Python code snippet below generates a
          Cinespace LUT which has a logarithmically spaced input
          domain and a linearly spaced output table and thus will
          not show the issue.</p>
          <p class="indent">table = np.linspace(0, 1, 4096) LUT =
          LUT1D(table, ’Linear to ACEScct’, domain)</p>
          <p class="indent">While GUI tools, such as LightSpace and
          Lattice, are available and can create and convert both 1D
          and 3D LUTs, they cannot work with LUTs which include
          both a 1D shaper and a 3D cube in the same file. Neither
          can Nuke’s GenerateLUT node. Therefore it is necessary
          either to manually split the process under consideration
          into the 1D and 3D components, and bake separate LUTs, or
          else use command line tools such as OCIO’s ociobakelut
          which have options to select a shaper space and range for
          formats which support combined 1D + 3D LUTs. For example,
          the command below will create a Cinespace LUT which will
          apply the ACES RRT plus Rec. 709 ODT:</p>
          <p class="indent">Using Colour Science for Python, as
          previously, it is possible to write the shaper and cube
          components of a transform to a Resolve .cube or Cinespace
          .csp LUT. The code listed below creates a shaper ranging
          from six stops below mid-grey to six stops above it, and
          a cube which applies the transform which is the
          difference between the shaper and f(input):</p>

          <p class="indent">Because most LUTs are text files, it is

          which can be used in the OCIOFileTransform node of Nuke,
          this same LUT file cannot be applied in DaVinci Resolve.
          Resolve supports combined 1D + 3D LUTs, but the format
          required is not currently available with ociobakelut in
          OCIO v1. However the Houdini and Resolve combined LUT
          formats are sufficiently similar, that the necessary

          for the parsing to get out of step, producing a result
          which may superficially match the intent for some, but
          not all images. For example, the Iridas and Resolve .cube
          LUT formats are broadly similar, but the tokens for input
          range differ, and may not be read properly (or at all) by
          some LUT parsers. It is always wise, where possible, to

          <p class="noindent">While LUTs remain widely used for
          real-time image processing, there is a move in many
          systems towards the use of shaders to apply color
          transforms on the GPU. This allows for mathematically
          precise transforms, without the range limitations or
          interpolation errors which can occur with LUTs. The
          distortion shown in Figure XX would not happen is a

          <p class="indent">Shaders also have the advantage that
