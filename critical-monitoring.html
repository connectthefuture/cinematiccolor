          <p class="noindent">DI grading is done in a viewing
          environment that exactly mirrors the final primary
          exhibition. Digital intermediate (and mastering)
          typically have very tight tolerances on calibration, as
          the decisions made in this process are the last time
          image color appearance is tweaked.</p>
          <p class="indent">An issue in some feature production is
          that the typical artist display does not match the
          eventual theatrical viewing specification or environment;
          some audiences will see more color detail than the
          original artist. Workstations commonly use sRGB or Rec.
          709 displays, which represent the smallest color space
          and lowest dynamic range used in distribution.
          Workstation displays are often not even calibrated beyond
          an eyeball check. Theatrical releases use the slightly
          wider P3 color space and there is a fast-growing home
          market for HDR content, which also uses a P3 limited
          color space but has considerably more dynamic range than
          traditional displays. Streaming companies like Netflix
          are increasingly producing original content in HDR.</p>
          <p class="indent">Histograms are a useful tool when
          analyzing image fidelity, and often help forensically
          track down if post-processing has been applied to an
          image. For example, log frames from certain
          motion-picture cameras often do not make full use of the
          integer coding space. This can be detected in the
          histogram and is helpful in tracking down an image color
          space when the original is unknown. The application of
          sharpening filters, detectable from their residual
          undershoot and overshoot, can also be observed in the
          histograms. It is possible to detect if image
          quantization has occurred, appearing as tell-tale
          “comb-like” peaks and valleys in the histogram.
          Leveraging histograms computed on HSV-transformed imagery
          as a final quality-check has been proven to be an
          invaluable tool.</p>
          <p class="indent">There are other image artifacts, such
          as aliasing, that are best inspected on moving imagery.
          For example, the use of interpolation kernels, such as
          nearest-neighbor or bilinear, are often unobjectionable
          on still imagery yet artifact-inducing on slowly
          animating transforms, particularly near horizontal lines.
          Always be on the lookout for moire patterns and other
          high-frequency artifacts, particularly when such filters
          have been applied to imagery with fine details, such as
          cloth, or wave patterns. If all digital imagery were
          ideally sampled, this would not be an issue. However,
          camera manufacturers have a tendency to bias imagery to
          be overly-sharp and motion transformations accentuate
          such artifacts. Over sharpening is less common with
          high-end digital cinema cameras.</p>
          <p class="indent">For stereo deliveries, it’s critical to
          quality check both eyes individually, as well as together
          in a proper stereo viewing environment. There are many
          stereo artifacts which are only visible on true 3D
          displays, and catching these early on is most
          cost-effective.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.8.1</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-30-121" id="x30-1210003.8.1">Cinema
          Projection</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Mastering for digital cinema should
          be done in an equivalent theatrical setting with matched
          digital projection. Film print is rarely the primary
          release today, but if the project does call for it, the
          DI grade is usually in a theatrical environment with a
          digital projector, with a film emulation 3D-LUT made in
          conjunction with the film lab to confirm a visual match
          with the stock, chemistry, and processing. Producing a
          calibrated film LUT is expensive and time-consuming, so
          it is more common to create a DCI P3 master and match the
          film release to that.</p>
          <p class="indent">If possible, attending the grade or an
          early test screening is informative and educational.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.8.2</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-30-122" id="x30-1220003.8.2">Reference
          Monitors</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Home theater mastering should be done
          in an “idealized” home environment. Usually, the
          idealized home environment is slightly darker than the
          real home environment and display gamma of 2.4 is used to
          compensate. When seen in a room with more ambient light
          the master will look correct with 2.2 display gamma,
          which is the target for consumer televisions. The purpose
          of the darker environment for mastering is to make shadow
          detail and colors more discernible, thereby creating a
          more accurate master. Rec. 709 does not specify the
          display gamma but this was later clarified in BT.
          1886.</p>
          <p class="indent">Note that whilst sRGB and Rec. 709
          share the same primary color coordinates, the display
          gamma is quite different and decisions on tonal detail
          should not be made on one for the other. The purpose of
          sRGB as a preview color space is more to assess the
          content than the look.</p>
          <p class="indent">Similarly, many motion pictures
          designed for theatrical release are finished on a
          calibrated monitor rather than a projector. Many of the
          monitors in use calibrate well to DCI P3 and the room
          lighting is often close to the theatrical experience. In
          this situation, the main cause of problems is the size of
          the screen and only experience will tell how the
          perception of the image will differ on the big screen.
          Techniques such as vignetting work well to focus
          attention on a small display but can reduce the sense of
          space in a theatre, reminding the audience that they are
          in a dark room watching a screen.</p>
          <p class="indent">A final obvious consideration is the
          display calibration: cheaper displays drift quicker than
          more expensive ones, but all displays used for finishing
          and critical decision making need regular checks and
          calibration. Often calibration is done using display
          menus, but calibration LUTs, loaded into the display or
          an external LUT box can be quicker and more accurate. For
          a calibration LUT to be effective the display’s native
          gamut must exceed that of the target.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.8.3</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-30-123" id="x30-1230003.8.3">HDR
          Displays</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Consumer HDR displays are
          commercially available today and content can come from
          video streaming, Blu-ray players, games machines and even
          live transmissions. The professional HDR displays are
          extremely expensive, often 10 times more than
          conventional SDR displays, and therefore rarer. The
          brightest consumer displays reach about 1000 nit. The
          brightest professional reference monitor is currently
          4000 nits but only available through Dolby. The brightest
          commercially available professional reference display is
          currently the FSI XM310K, which reaches 3000 nits. There
          are several reference displays that are 1000 nits or
          better and that meet the other criteria for HDR. HDR
          display mastering must be done on a display of at least
          1000 nits, with full P3 gamut and a white point of D65.
          Scene-referred sources, VFX and CG content should
          preserve as much highlight range as possible in order
          that the mapping to the display range can be chosen for
          creative reasons, rather than imposed by technical
          limitations. Clipping generally looks bad on HDR
          displays.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.8.4</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-30-124" id="x30-1240003.8.4">Color
          Management for Mastering</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Ideally, a single Master is created
          and all versions taken from it using metadata, transforms
          or trims. To achieve the best results the Master should
          be created and approved in the highest dynamic range and
          widest color gamut, but even then care is needed to map
          the Master data to each version. A poor mapping may
          produce artifacts that range from minor to catastrophic
          but is always avoidable.</p>
          <p class="indent">Sometimes it is unavoidable that the
          first Master is not the ideal dynamic range or color
          gamut and sometimes it is limited in other ways, such as
          bit depth or lossy compression. In this situation, the
          best route to delivering other versions is to go back to
          the project file and remove the embedded limitations of
          the first Master. A typical problem in this scenario is
          managing expectations when approval has been given for a
          Master of limited range. Some clients insist on a
          faithful transition between formats, even if the
          limitations of the approved Master are carried over to
          the other versions. Others are more open minded and
          prefer to forego absolute accuracy in favor of higher
          quality versions.</p>
          <p class="indent">When media is used in a scene-referred
          workflow it is important to manage detail and artistic
          intent through the pipeline. The following details from
          the Disney movie “Moana” illustrate how color management
          is used at each stage so that tonal information is
          preserved throughout.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image Disney. All Rights Reserved. This
          is a representation of an extract from the scene-referred
          linear EXR source. Since there is no tone mapping much of
          the tonal information in the shadows and the highlights
          appears clipped. It is a useful scene-referred image, but
          hard to monitor in a meaningful way without tone mapping
          and the display transform approved for the project.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image Disney. All Rights Reserved. This
          is a representation of the same scene-referred linear EXR
          with 4 stops less exposure. Most of the image is now
          close to the display black point, but of course still,
          present in the EXR file. Dropping the exposure shows that
          there is good highlight information in the image and that
          the dynamic range is greater than the display can handle
          without some tone mapping or clipping.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image Disney. All Rights Reserved. This
          representation has 2.2 gamma applied. Gamma brings the
          shadow detail into range on a Rec. 709 display, but
          information above 1.0 is still clipped. This is evident
          in the eye of the fire goddess, Te Fiti, the brighter
          parts of the sea and the sky.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image Disney. All Rights Reserved. This
          is the EXR file with 2.2 gamma and 4 stops less exposure.
          Again it reveals that there is highlight information but
          it is a poor representation of the artistic intent.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image Disney. All Rights Reserved. Here
          the image has had a PQ EOTF added and the color gamut
          converted to Rec. 2020. Some tone-mapping has also been
          applied. On an HDR display the full impact of the color
          and dynamic range are visible, but the image looks flat
          and desaturated on a 709 display. Color encoding to
          high-dynamic range and a wider color gamut uses lower
          code values, with less color separation, than would be
          used by Rec. 709 for the same display colorimetry. In
          this example, the detail in the highlights of the water
          is retained, but the detail in the eye of the lava
          creature has been limited for artistic reasons. The
          scene-referred linear EXR clearly has more detail in tone
          and color than is shown in this PQ image and the PQ Rec.
          2020 encoding certainly has the capability to show that
          detail. However, the effect on the final audience is not
          based merely on a technical transform and the colorist
          must consider the emotional response too. The important
          factor is that an informed decision is only made if the
          detail is present in the source. If there was no detail
          in the original EXR then the more limited version is the
          only option and that could impact the look of other
          scenes or even the whole project.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image Disney. All Rights Reserved. This
          is a colorimetric Rec. 709 transform with 2.2 gamma of
          the PQ Rec. 2020 version. Again, this results in
          clipping, not just in the eye, but also the sea and sky,
          as it uses picture information from only the lowest part
          of the HDR range. The clipping goes beyond the white
          highlights but also manifests as over-saturated loss of
          detail in the blue of the wave.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image Disney. All Rights Reserved. This
          image is also from a Rec. 709 2.2 gamma export, but this
          time using creative tone mapping. The artistic intent of
          the bright eye is retained, even to the point of a slight
          yellow tint. This version retains all the detail of the
          sea tonal range and color separation without
          clipping.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image Disney. All Rights Reserved. A
          butterfly wipe between the tone mapped version (top) and
          the clipped transform (bottom) shows the benefit of
          mapping over blind transforms. Sometimes tone mapping is
          achieved with mathematical algorithms and sometimes this
          level of control is the domain of the colorist.</p>

          <p class="noindent">Tone mapping is concerned with
          dynamic range, which can affect color, as the previous
          example showed. Gamut mapping adjusts colors between
          different color gamuts. Understanding how to read files
          without a display of the correct gamut is a useful
          skill.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image Disney. All Rights Reserved. This
          is a crop from the original P3 gamut source. It will only
          look as intended on a P3 calibrated display. On a Rec.
          709 or sRGB display the image will appear less saturated
          than it should, but the color detail is visible.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image Disney. All Rights Reserved. Here
          is the same crop, converted to Rec. 709 with clipping in
          the red channel evident on the cheek, shirt and
          background. The saturation level is now correct and the
          transfer function and white point remain the same but the
          clipping artifacts are objectionable and an unnecessary
          compromise since there is no clipping in the P3 source.
          The clipped colors are valid in the P3 gamut, but out of
          the Rec. 709 gamut.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image Disney. All Rights Reserved. This
          version shows a gamut warning. The zebra pattern
          identifies all areas of the P3 source that are outside of
          the 709 gamut and helps to direct the artist to where
          artifacts will occur if no further action is taken.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image Disney. All Rights Reserved. This
          version shows the Rec. 709 gamut master after gamut
          mapping the colors that were outside of the Rec. 709
          gamut to appropriate colors inside the Rec. 709 gamut to
          avoid clipping in the red channel. The difference is
          subtle on the printed page but significantly better than
          the clipped approach. Most colors that were already
          visible in the Rec. 709 gamut remain unchanged, only the
          out of gamut colors and those with the highest saturation
          are different. The result has minimal impact on artistic
          intent, retains the highly saturated look and yet avoids
          a loss of detail in the 709 version.</p>
          <p class="indent">Image copyright Disney 2018 This
          butterfly split of the clipped image on the left and the
          mapped image on the right shows the improvement in the
          cheek and the hem of the shirt. Had the original master
          been the Rec. 709 version on the right, the P3 version
          would look identical to the Rec. 709 version when seen on
          a P3 display, though it would still look less saturated
          when seen incorrectly on a Rec. 709 display. No gamut
          mapping would be required. However, the opportunity to
          push the saturated look that is clearly intended, to the
          limits of P3 would be lost.</p>
