          <p class="noindent">Like color management, an archival
          procedure is relatively straightforward if it is included
          in planning from the start and incredibly traumatic if it
          has to be implemented after everything else. In a planned
          environment, archiving is little more than good
          housekeeping but the cost of introducing it retroactively
          can often be prohibitive. One of the initial driving
          forces behind ACES was the lack of standards around color
          in archiving, and The Academy have recently published
          their Academy Digital Source Master draft specification,
          with the aim of standardizing the delivery archiving of
          ACES projects.</p>
          <p class="indent">Project managers should consider how
          long the archive needs to last and to what purpose. The
          duration might be until the production is complete,
          delivered and fully signed off with the intention that
          even if a team has moved on to other things, all elements
          could be restored and work resumed should the need arise.
          This archive is separate from the day to day storage used
          by each department or facility, it is an untouched copy
          that is available if data is lost, corrupted or
          inaccessible. Alternatively, the archive could be part of
          a comprehensive asset management system intended to
          protect and future-proof valuable content. In theory,
          both scenarios face the same problems, but the solutions
          for risk management will differ in practice.</p>
          <p class="indent">The challenges associated with archives
          can be simply stated as: preservation of the data
          preservation of the means to access the data ease of
          access low maintenance</p>
          <p class="indent">As a rule, the best-preserved data is
          the least easy to access. A painting locked in a bank
          vault has a better chance of surviving intact than a
          painting on the wall of a cafe. Similarly, the safest
          digital files are those that do not have direct access by
          a host of users. Access to the original digital data
          requires a physical reader device, a compatible operating
          system with suitable software and the necessary ancillary
          support to view or use the data correctly. Within the
          concerns of this paper, that includes a display
          calibrated to the correct color gamut or the means to
          create a correct transform to interpret the images as
          intended. There should also be a file, document or
          metadata that specifies the correct color gamut. The
          metadata for HDR10 and Dolby Vision requires this but
          other formats assume that a display gamut. The Thomson
          Viper camera is a good long-term example of the pitfalls
          for archives. It was one of the first cameras to capture
          data rather than video or film. Much of the media shot on
          it was stored on videotape and required proprietary LUTs
          to correctly remove the inherent green bias. In the
          decade since the camera was introduced, those VTRs have
          become scarce. To retrieve Viper data, the tapes would
          have to have been well stored and you would have to
          locate a VTR. Additionally, there are no Input Transforms
          to bring Viper Filmstream data into an ACES workflow.</p>
          <p class="indent">Preserving lossless copies of the
          digital data requires an ongoing managed schedule of
          refreshing, migrating and replicating the data.</p>
          <p class="indent">Refreshing is the transfer of data
          between two types of the same storage medium to protect
          against corruption or drive failure. This requires at
          least three copies so that any time one becomes different
          to the others, it is replaced. Checksum hashes should be
          calculated from the original media, and stored alongside
          each copy, so that its integrity can be subsequently
          verified. Even the loss of one bit can render an entire
          file unusable and there is a condition known as bit-rot
          that is statistically relevant to larger libraries. When
          an archive reaches a certain size some bit-rot is
          certain, although where it occurs is not. However, the
          highest risk to digital data is at the time of access and
          is caused either by operator error, or accidental
          deletion. For this reason, most archives do not allow
          access to the source content, they only allow content to
          be copied out of the archive.</p>
          <p class="indent">Duplicating the data is called
          Replication and of course, the more copies that exist,
          the less an asset is vulnerable to being lost. In the
          days of film, every release print made was a form of
          replication that increased the chances of an asset
          surviving. Unfortunately, however, there is a conflict of
          interest when an asset has commercial value. A studio
          that derives its income from sales of its content does
          not want countless copies in the market and therefore
          needs to plan and fund replication of high-quality master
          copies. When DVD and Rec. 709 broadcast were the biggest
          markets, studios archived to HD. As SDR HD has become
          more omnipresent, studios are moving to HDR UHD
          mastering. A few are already storing scene-referred
          copies of the graded and ungraded DI Masters with
          metadata that manages versioning for sound, picture
          format, length, and localization. This impacts the
          production and post-production pipeline since
          deliverables that are immediately compatible with the
          archive are likely to be a contractual requirement and
          that could narrow the workflow options. Replication and
          refreshing should include geo-redundant sites to avoid
          total failure in the event of a fire or similar
          catastrophe.</p>
          <p class="indent">Short term archival needs might be
          covered by refreshing and replicating, but long-term
          preservation also requires planned migration. Migration
          is the transfer of data to newer technologies. That could
          be a new file format, an updated operating system or
          different storage media. The move from analog to digital
          and the move from tape to file delivery are both examples
          of migration. The cost of migration for an archive can be
          very high, so it is good practice to future proof the
          assets as much as possible. Working scene-referred and
          keeping a scene-referred master saves very expensive
          re-mastering later and gives content a longer shelf life.
          However, migration of storage media, operating systems
          and file formats still apply. Often visual effects,
          editors and colorists save projects as part of the
          archive backup, but these have a relatively limited
          usefulness as software evolves and unless changes are
          requested projects are rarely migrated.</p>

          Archives Information System (OAIS)</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">In the 1970’s NASA recorded vast
          amounts of data from its space program and had an urgent
          need to develop a standard for practical long-term
          preservation of digital files. The resulting OAIS has
          since been the foundation for the digital archives of
          governments, libraries and content archives, large and
          small, around the world. The latest version is the
          Magenta Book of 2012 which describes the recommended
          practice for an organization of people and systems to
          protect and make available digital information. The word
          "Open" in the title refers to transparency of the system
          rather than meaning that access to the information should
          be unrestricted. It has been ratified as ISO
          14721:2012.</p>
          <p class="indent">The model uses the following terms for
          its components: Producers create content and are
          production and post-production for purposes of this paper
          Archive is the physical data storage of completed
          material, not work in progress. Managers are those
          responsible for the policies that govern the Archive
          Consumers are those that have legitimate access to the
          Archive content, not the end user.</p>
          <p class="indent">OAIS Archive Model</p>
          <p class="indent">It defines an Information Object as the
          product of a Data Object plus its Representation
          Information. Data Object is a digital file, for example,
          an image file. Representation Information is everything
          needed to understand that file. In the example of an
          image file that must include the file format, how to read
          that format and also everything required to display the
          file correctly. Information Object is content that is
          preserved in the archive. Without the representation
          information, the data is at risk of being lost since
          there is an unreasonable assumption that the Knowledge
          Base for reading and understanding the information will
          always be universally known. The recommended practice
          likens this to a simple English text, without a suitable
          dictionary and grammar explanation.</p>
          <p class="indent">OAIS Information Object</p>
          <p class="indent">The simple information object is moved
          in and out of the archive and stored there as an
          Information Package, which consists of Content
          Information and Preservation Description Information
          (PDI). There needs to be some Packaging Information that
          keeps these two elements together and Descriptive
          Information that describes what the Information Package
          contains. The Descriptive Information could be as simple
          as a file name, or a more complicated list of delivery
          specifications.</p>
          <p class="indent">Information Package</p>
          <p class="indent">The PDI clearly identifies the Content
          Information and the model goes on to identify five types
          of information that should be recorded. Provenance
          describes the source, history, and ownership of the
          material Context describes any relationships with other
          content, for example, an episode in a series. It might
          contain other relationships such as the originating
          studio, producer or director. Reference information
          should include any unique identifiers that are or could
          be used to recognize the content in one or more systems
          Fixity is protection from undocumented alteration and
          could be in the form of a checksum or other method of
          ensuring that the information is as described Access
          Rights contains the terms of access, ownership,
          licensing, and permission for preservation operations as
          well as specifications for rights enforcement and access
          control.</p>
          <p class="indent">The Reference Model for an Open
          Archival Information System Magenta Book goes into a lot
          more detail on setting up, managing and using an archive,
          which is beyond the scope of this paper. This basic
          introduction to data management is however relevant at
          all stages of data production, manipulation and delivery
          and is worth bearing in mind when sharing digital files
          between software, departments or organizations.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.10.2</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-32-132" id="x32-1310003.10.2">Archive
          Elements</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">The primary archival asset for motion
          picture projects is the master deliverable or
          deliverables since these are ready for use as long as
          their formats are current. File names and/or metadata
          should clearly identify the intended display description
          including the primaries, the EOTF and the white point.
          HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats include this information
          in their metadata. With DCP and IMF packages there can be
          a single master with alternative scenes and soundtracks
          included in the package, together with metadata to
          generate other versions.</p>
          <p class="indent">Some content owners demand an ungraded
          master for archiving. This is more useful if the DI
          project is also available, though the content owner is
          rarely the keeper of any project files. Projects for DI
          grades, editing or VFX are difficult to preserve intact.
          Software and hardware changes eventually leave projects
          unusable, so a good archive will keep the software
          version, operating system and hardware if it needs to
          recover projects. The project will also need the source
          files to be fully usable and many facilities use a fixed
          folder structure for each project to make a full backup
          easier.</p>
