          <p class="noindent">Thus far, mainly unrelated color,
          i.e. color in isolation such as street lights against the
          night darkness has been considered. However, real objects
          and their colors are rarely perceived in isolation, on
          the contrary, objects are almost systematically seen in
          the context of many others. Therefore, their colors are
          said to be related.</p>
          <p class="indent">Fairchild (2013) presents the
          perception of gray and brown colors as an example
          illustrating related colors:</p>
          <p class="indent">It is not possible to see unrelated
          colors that appear either gray or brown. Gray is an
          achromatic color with lightness significantly lower than
          white. Brown is an orange color with low lightness. Both
          of these color name definitions require specific
          lightness levels. [...] To convince yourself, search for
          a light that can be viewed in isolation (i.e., completely
          dark environment) and that appears either gray or
          brown.</p>
          <p class="indent">One might infer that color appearance
          is affected by its surroundings and this is indeed the
          case. The study of color appearance is the objective of
          advanced colorimetry.</p>
          <p class="indent">Fairchild (2013) references a citation
          from Wyszecki (1973) describing basic colorimetry
          first:</p>
          <p class="indent">Colorimetry, in its strict sense, is a
          tool used to making a prediction on whether two lights
          (visual stimuli) of different spectral power
          distributions will match in color for certain given
          conditions of observation. The prediction is made by
          determining the tristimulus values of the two visual
          stimuli. If the tristimulus values of a stimulus are
          identical to those of the other stimulus, a color match
          will be observed by an average observer with normal color
          vision.</p>
          <p class="indent">And then advanced colorimetry:</p>
          <p class="indent">Colorimetry in its broader sense
          includes methods of assessing the appearance of color
          stimuli presented to the observer in complicated
          surroundings as they may occur in everyday life. This is
          considered the ultimate goal of colorimetry, but because
          of its enormous complexity, this goal is far from being
          reached. On the other hand, certain more restricted
          aspects of the overall problem of predicting color
          appearance of stimuli seem somewhat less elusive. The
          outstanding examples are the measurement of color
          differences, whiteness, and chromatic adaptation. Though
          these problems are still essentially unresolved, the
          developments in these areas are of considerable interest
          and practical importance.</p>
          <p class="indent">Advanced colorimetry and color
          appearance models extend basic colorimetry by making
          predictions about the perception of color under various
          viewing conditions. While its exploration is out of the
          scope of this document, viewing conditions, elementary
          terminology and various color appearance phenomena will
          be defined as some are necessary to understand various
          concepts touched on. Fairchild (2013) is a recommended
          reading for in-depth information, and Luo et Li (2013)

          <p class="noindent">The Purkinje Effect or Purkinje Shift
          describes the shift toward the blue end of the color
          spectrum of peak luminance sensitivity of the HVS at low
          illumination levels. Two objects, one red and one blue
          which appear to have the same lightness in daylight will
          appear differently under scotopic illumination levels:
          the red will appear nearly black and the blue relatively
          light.</p>

          <p class="noindent">The Helmholtz–Kohlrausch Effect
          describes the perceived variation in brightness of a
          color stimulus induced by increased saturation and hue
          variation of the stimulus while keeping its luminance
          constant. Helmholtz–Kohlrausch Effect: the luminance of
          each sample is the same as that of the background and
          constant. The bottom part of the image represents an
          achromatic version of each above sample.</p>

          id="x19-620002.5.3">Hunt Effect, Hunt (1952)</a></h5>
          <p class="noindent">The Hunt Effect describes the
          perceived colorfulness increase of color stimuli induced
          by luminance increase. Conversely the colorfulness of
          colors decreases as the adapting light intensity is
          reduced. Hunt (1952) also found that at high illumination
          levels, increasing the test color intensity caused most
          colors to become bluer.</p>

          (1963)</a></h5>
          <p class="noindent">The Stevens Effect describes the
          perceived brightness (or lightness) contrast increase of
          color stimuli induced by luminance increase.</p>

          (1938)</a></h5>
          <p class="noindent">The Helson-Judd effect happens when a
          light source illuminates a greyscale, light regions of
          the greyscale exhibit chroma of the same hue of the light
          source while dark regions exhibit chroma of the
          complementary hue of the light source. The Helson-Judd
          effect is subtle and is usually not accounted for in
          practical situations.</p>
