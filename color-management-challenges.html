          Management Challenges</a></h3>
          <p class="noindent">While the approaches in different
          industries and departments have converged, there are
          still many challenges when speaking about and working
          with color. They are:</p>
          <p class="indent">Multiple Requirements: It is difficult
          to lump on-set capture, visual effects, animation, games,
          grading and finishing into a single bucket, as each
          discipline has potentially different color pipeline goals
          and constraints. For example, in visual effects
          production, one of the golden rules is that image regions
          absent of visual effects should not be modified in any
          way. This places a constraint on color pipelines: that
          color conversions applied to the photography must be
          perfectly invertible. Animation and games have their own
          unique set of requirements, such as high-fidelity
          handling of saturated portions of the color gamut along
          with large areas of smooth color gradients. On-set
          capture teams are focused on a shot to shot consistency,
          capturing as much dynamic range with as little noise as
          possible. Grading teams have to deliver a set of final
          images that retain the intended look and feel of the
          production and take maximum advantage of the output
          device(s), standard dynamic range (SDR) and high-dynamic
          range (HDR). Thus, color pipelines must keep track of the
          “big picture” priorities but are often tailored to
          specific productions and groups.</p>
          <p class="indent">Varying Terminology: Working with color
          in a single production setting can be a challenge. An
          additional complicating factor is the abundance of
          overlapping and overloaded terminology for describing
          color and operations on color. As more parts of the
          production pipeline interact, from on-set capture to
          visual effects to grading and mastering, the history, and
          constraints that defined how each group thinks and talks
          about color come in contact when they may not have
          previously. Terms like grade, HDR, linear, brightness,
          gamma, light, look development or LUT may have clear, but
          different, meanings in two adjacent production groups. On
          top of overloaded terms, many acronyms in use add a level
          of perceived complexity to what would otherwise be an
          easily understood process. The Glossary in the Appendix
          is our attempt to address some of this overloading of
          terms.</p>
          <p class="indent">Various Color Philosophies: There are
          many schools of thought on how to best manage color in
          digital motion-picture production. There is far more
          variation in motion-picture color management than in
          desktop publishing. Some facilities render in
          high-dynamic range (HDR) color spaces. Other facilities
          prefer to render in low-dynamic range (LDR). Some
          facilities rely on the output display characteristics,
          like gamma, as the primary tool in crafting the final
          image appearance. Others do not. It is challenging to
          provide standardized workflows and toolsets when the
          current practice has such variation.</p>
          <p class="indent">Multiple Inputs Outputs: In live-action
          productions, imagery is often acquired using a multitude
          of input capture devices: multiple digital motion picture
          cameras from different vendors, still cameras, “action
          cameras,” specialized HDR panorama cameras, LIDAR
          scanners, and it is desired to merge these different
          sources seamlessly. On the output side, the final image
          deliverables are tailored to distinct viewing
          environments: digital theatrical presentation, film
          theatrical presentation, SDR and HDR home theater,
          television broadcast, augmented and virtual reality
          devices. The rapid evolution of HDR display’s brightness
          and color gamut standards poses particular challenges for
          content creation and grading. Each of these outputs has
          different color considerations. Furthermore, artists
          often work on desktop displays with “office” viewing
          conditions, yet require a high-fidelity preview of the
          final appearance.</p>
          <p class="indent">Complex Software Ecosystem: Another
          challenge is that the majority of the motion picture,
          visual effects, animation and games productions use many
          software tools: on-set monitoring, LUT boxes, image
          viewers, 2D and 3D painting applications, compositing
          applications, lighting tools, editing and grading suite,
          media generation and transcoding software and so on.
          Although it is imperative that artists work in a color
          managed pipeline across multiple applications, color
          support is quite varied between software vendors.
          Ideally, all software tools that interchange images,
          perform color conversions or display images should be
          color managed consistently. This is not the case. Each
          production and facility has to understand the
          capabilities and behavior of the applications they elect
          to use as part of their pipeline design. The issue of
          interchange takes on an even more complex angle when you
          consider that multiple facilities often share image
          assets on a single production. Color management practices
          and technologies that encourage high-fidelity, consistent
          interchange are sorely needed.</p>
          <p class="indent">Protecting Imagery: On-set capture,
          visual effects, and animation are not the end of the line
          for image processing. Digital intermediate (DI) Grading
          is a powerful tool for crafting the final appearance of a
          motion picture that may substantially impact the
          appearance of the final image. It is, therefore, a
          necessity for on-set capture and post-production color
          pipelines to protect the fidelity of the captured and
          rendered image, even under drastic color corrections. It
          is very likely that late stage color corrections will
          reveal underlying problems in the captured or
          computer-generated imagery if digital intermediate is not
          considered earlier in production. Artifacts not visible
          in production because of the viewing conditions or
          introduced by changes made in post-production might be
          very obvious in HDR or at 2 stops less exposure. The
          eventual application of compression is also a
          consideration. Future-Proofing Required: Display
          technology is continually evolving, most recently with
          high resolution (UltraHD), wide color gamut (Rec. 2020)
          and higher dynamic range (Rec. 2100). For large
          productions, it is very prudent to take all steps
          possible to future-proof the computer-generated (CG)
          imagery so that visual effects (VFX) elements can be
          repurposed and do not need to be recreated when the next
          generation of display technology appears. It is good
          practice to work and archive at the source resolution.
          Color space, bit depth, and dynamic range should also be
          protected. These requirements can be very demanding of
          storage, bandwidth and processing power in modern times,
          often resulting in the use of compression algorithms to
          ease the strain. Some of these may be visually lossless
          yet still impact the color pipeline in the later
          stages.</p>
