<p class="noindent">ACES (Academy Color Encoding System) Color
management system standardized by A.M.P.A.S. which defines a wide
gamut scene-referred linear working space, and the transforms
needed to map to that from other color encodings. ACES also defines
the transforms to display ACES image data on various standard
displays, as well as metadata to communicate creative intent and
other information. The acronym ACES may also stand for Academy
Color Encoding Specification, the ACES2065-1 color encoding.</p>
<p class="indent">ASC CDL American Society of Cinematographers
Color Decision List. See Appendix 4.5 for more detail. A list of
color parameters that can be shared as XML or within EDL files and
applied in most color grading systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Block Compression A form of lossy texture
compression, usually hardware accelerated, which operates on fixed
resolution blocks. Typically these blocks are 4x4 with compression
ratios of 4:1 or 8:1, but this is not always the case. Follow the
links in the “Block compression” part of Appendix 4.14.4 for more
details.</p>
<p class="indent">Bokeh The appearance of the out of focus part of
an image, characterised by discs with the same shape as the iris of
the lens, which are most apparent around bright sources.</p>
<p class="indent">BT.2100 ITU-R BT.2100, referred to as BT.2100 or
Rec. 2100 is the main ITU standards document for HDR. It defines
the OETF and EOTF for both PQ and HLG, as well as specifying an
OOTF for each. It also gives the spatial and temporal
characteristics (pixel dimensions and frame rate) for HDR, and
details of Y’CbCr encodings and SDI transmission.</p>
<p class="indent">CSI Colorist Society International (CSI) strives
to advance the craft, education and awareness of the art and
science of color grading and color correction.

<p class="indent">Code Values Discrete values for 8, 10, 12 or 16
bit integer encodings. For example, a 10 bit image has 1024 code
values, numbering from 0 to 1023.</p>
<p class="indent">Color Management Techniques used to ensure that
the intended appearance of an image is reproduced in the same way
everywhere it is viewed. This may include Color Appearance Modeling
to account for differences in viewing environment and display
brightness, or may simply ensure identical absolute display
colorimetry on all displays (within the limitations of a particular
display).</p>
<p class="indent">Digital Intermediate (DI) The process of
manipulating color and other characteristics of digital images
prior to theatrical release. DI is currently used for both film and
video markets and uses software with a data workflow rather than
hardware and a tape-based pipeline. The term was originally used by
Kodak to define a workflow from film negatives to digital
manipulation and back to film. (from
http://www.finalcolor.com/glossary-1/). It is commonly used in VFX
to mean color grading and finishing, which is a narrower definition
than the term originally intended but is the preferred meaning in
this document.</p>
<p class="indent">Defocus The optical effect caused by light rays
converging in front of or behind the plane of the sensor in a
camera. Simulated in post by convolving the image with a kernel
with the same shape as the lens iris, and size proportional to the
desired defocus.</p>
<p class="indent">Display-referred see output referred image
state</p>
<p class="indent">Dmin Minimum density on the characteristic curve
of a film stock’s response.</p>
<p class="indent">Display Transform See Output Transform</p>
<p class="indent">D65 The CIE standard daylight illuminant
(approximately 6504K, although not actually on the Planckian locus)
used as the white point for televisions, HD video monitors and most
computer displays. The CIE defines the chromaticity coordinates of
D65 as (0.31272, 0.32903) but Rec. 709 and many other color
encoding specifications use a form rounded to four decimal
places.</p>
<p class="indent">EDL (Edit Decision List) Text file used to convey
the shots used in a cut, and their positions in the timeline,
between different editing and grading systems. Historically EDLs
were used to transfer edits from non-linear offline editing systems
(and before that tape based offlines) to the high quality
multi-machine tape editing systems. Various forms exist, but the
most commonly used are based on the CMX3600 format.</p>
<p class="indent">EOTF (Electro-Optical Transfer Function) The
mathematical mapping between the output-referred pixel values and
the luminance on a particular display.</p>
<p class="indent">Encoding gamut The gamut chosen by a camera
manufacturer for use in mapping the specific response from their
sensor and filter’s spectral response curves to chromaticities.</p>
<p class="indent">Gamut The range of colors able to be represented
by positive values in a particular color encoding. Gamuts are often
shown as triangles on a CIE xy or u*v* plot, but these, in fact,
are only a projection of the volume of the color gamut, as the
luminance component is not shown.</p>
<p class="indent">HDR (High Dynamic Range) HDR has multiple
meanings: It is a set of techniques that allow a greater dynamic
range of exposures or values (i.e. a wider range of values between
light and dark areas) to be handled than normal digital imaging
techniques. HDR image capture encodes a wider than normal dynamic
range from the scene, without applying any tone mapping or other
processing to make the result suitable for direct display. This may
be done either by combining multiple bracketed exposures from a
lower dynamic range device, or by using a camera which has an
inherently high dynamic range. HDR image processing is the most
common usage in this document and within the VFX community. It is
used to mean working with wide dynamic range scene referred data in
a manner which preserves the dynamic range, either by using
unclamped floating point linear processing, or a logarithmic
representation of the linear image data. HDR display is a set of
new technologies which use screen brightness significantly greater
than conventional displays. These displays use either a Perceptual
Quantizer (PQ/ ST.2084) or Hybrid Log Gamma (HLG) EOTF to display
images. Colorists, consumers, and distributors are likely to mean
HDR displays when they use the term HDR. Note: The term HDR is also
used to refer to images which use local tone mapping to prepare a
high dynamic range image for a standard dynamic range display,
producing the unnatural looking images often seen online. This
document does not ever use the term in that sense.</p>
<p class="indent">HLG (Hybrid Log Gamma) HDR encoding developed by
the BBC and NHK, and specified in ITU-R BT.2100, which defines an
OETF and EOTF, producing a system gamma OOTF. Unlike ST.2084, HLG
is a relative standard, with output brightness dependent on the
black and white levels of the display.</p>
<p class="indent">IDT see Input Transform</p>
<p class="indent">Input Transform Transform provided by a camera
manufacturer, or specified by A.M.P.A.S, to map a source encoding
to ACES2065-1.</p>
<p class="indent">IRE While strictly a unit of measurement of the
voltage in composite video signals, the term IRE is commonly used
to refer to the level of any signal between black and white as a
percentage, with 0 IRE being black and 100 IRE white. It is often
used to abstract the encoded signal from the code values used to
represent it, so in ”Legal Range” 0 IRE is 10 bit 64 and 100 IRE is
940. In ”Full Range” 0 IRE is 0 and 100 IRE is 1023.</p>
<p class="indent">Look Management Techniques used to communicate
the intended appearance of an image, including creative as well as
technical transforms, so that the same Look can be seen by all
involved.</p>
<p class="indent">LMT See Look Transform</p>
<p class="indent">Look Transform In an ACES pipeline a transform
applied downstream of grading operations to impart an overall look
to a show or scene.</p>
<p class="indent">LUT Box Hardware image processing device capable
of applying transforms implemented as LUTs to SDI or HDMI
signals.</p>
<p class="indent">Munsell Renotation System System developed by
Professor Albert H. Munsell in the early 20th century which
describes colors in terms of perceptually uniform hue, value
(lightness) and chroma.</p>
<p class="indent">NTSC (National Television System Committee)
Organization in the US founded to standardize the format for
television broadcasts. Commonly used to refer to the color
television standard defined by that committee. NTSC is a standard
definition interlaced format with 29.97 frames (59.94 fields) per
second, but the term is often loosely used to refer to any 30 or
29.97 fps video format, to distinguish it from formats based on the
European PAL 25 frames (50 fields) per second system. The precise
frame rate is in fact 30 <span class="cmsy-10">×</span>
1000/1001.</p>
<p class="indent">ODT (Output Device Transform) See Output
Transform</p>
<p class="indent">OECF (Opto-Electronic Conversion Function) See
OETF</p>
<p class="indent">OETF (Opto-Electronic Transfer Function) The
mathematical mapping between scene light and scene-referred pixel
values.</p>
<p class="indent">OOTF (Optical to Optical Transfer Function) The
mathematical mapping used to convert between scene-referred and
display-referred image data for the purposes of picture
rendering.</p>
<p class="indent">Output-referred image state Image state
associated with image data that represents the colorimetry of the
elements of an image that has undergone color rendering appropriate
for a specified real or virtual output device and viewing
conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Output Transform The ACES term for what is also
called a Display Transform, a mathematical mapping which transforms
scene-referred image data into display-referred, targeting a
particular class of display. This transform is not purely
colorimetric, but includes tone mapping and picture rendering.</p>
<p class="indent">Picture rendering A modification of the image
contrast to create a perceptual match between scene and
display.</p>
<p class="indent">Protect To choose operations, formats and
processing pipelines that do not clip intensities, gamuts or image
content, even where not noticeable in the current form, in order to
preserve maximum flexibility downstream.</p>
<p class="indent">PQ (Perceptual Quantizer aka Perceptual
Quantisation) EOTF standardized by SMPTE ST.2084 for HDR displays.
PQ is an output referred absolute encoding of HDR display
luminance, covering the range from 0 to 10,000 cd/m2. Originally
designed by Dolby under the name PQ for Perceptual Quantizer,
because each PQ code value increment represents an equal increase
in perceived brightness throughout the range. Quantizer and
Quantization are used interchangeably in discussions about PQ.
Quantizer was used originally by Dolby, but Quantization become
more commonly used later on, as in the ITU-R BT.2100 document.</p>
<p class="indent">Rushes Original unmodified files recorded by a
camera. Historically the term referred to the exposed negative or
recorded video tape, but the term is now used to refer either to
the files on the camera media, or a copy of those files made on set
or in a data lab.</p>
<p class="indent">Scene-referred image state Image state associated
with image data that represents estimates of the colorimetry of the
elements of a scene. Scene-referred image data typically represents
relative scene colorimetry estimates. Absolute scene colorimetry
estimates may be calculated using a scaling factor.</p>
<p class="indent">SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) Term used to
describe display systems not capable of high dynamic range;
normally used in contrast to HDR displays. Also used to describe
output-referred image data restricted to the 0-1 range (or integer
equivalent) suitable for display on SDR displays.</p>
<p class="indent">Small Floats These are floating-point
representations with fewer bits than the usual 16-bit
implementations. Overall range is similar to 16-bit since the 5-bit
exponent is preserved, but a reduced size mantissa reduces
precision and the sign bit is dropped. Links with more information
be found in the “Small float formats” part of Appendix 4.14.4.</p>
<p class="indent">ST.2084 See PQ</p>
<p class="indent">Trims Grading adjustments made after grading of
the primary master is complete, in order to make the image suitable
for a secondary deliverable.</p>
<p class="indent">View Transform See OOTF</p>
<p class="indent">Working Space The color space in which a
particular set of operations is performed. The choice of working
space has a significant effect on the way such operations act. Some
spaces may be more appropriate than others for certain operations,
and some may be entirely unsuitable. A color pipeline is likely to
use different working spaces at different points. They are often
transient color spaces, existing only within a grading or
compositing system, with transforms to and from the working space
applied either side of the operations.</p>
