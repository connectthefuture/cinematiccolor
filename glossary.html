          <p class="noindent">ACES (Academy Color Encoding System)
          Color management system standardized by A.M.P.A.S. which
          defines a wide gamut scene-referred linear working space,
          and the transforms needed to map to that from other color
          encodings. ACES also defines the transforms to display
          ACES image data on various standard displays, as well as
          metadata to communicate creative intent and other
          information. The acronym ACES may also stand for Academy
          Color Encoding Specification, the ACES2065-1 color
          encoding.</p>
          <p class="indent">ASC CDL American Society of
          Cinematographers Color Decision List. See Appendix 4.5
          for more detail. A list of color parameters that can be
          shared as XML or within EDL files and applied in most
          color grading systems.</p>
          <p class="indent">Block Compression A form of lossy
          texture compression, usually hardware accelerated, which
          operates on fixed resolution blocks. Typically these
          blocks are 4x4 with compression ratios of 4:1 or 8:1, but
          this is not always the case. Follow the links in the
          "Block compression" part of Appendix 4.14.4 for more
          details.</p>
          <p class="indent">Bokeh The appearance of the out of
          focus part of an image, characterised by discs with the
          same shape as the iris of the lens, which are most
          apparent around bright sources.</p>
          <p class="indent">BT.2100 ITU-R BT.2100, referred to as
          BT.2100 or Rec. 2100 is the main ITU standards document
          for HDR. It defines the OETF and EOTF for both PQ and
          HLG, as well as specifying an OOTF for each. It also
          gives the spatial and temporal characteristics (pixel
          dimensions and frame rate) for HDR, and details of Y’CbCr
          encodings and SDI transmission.</p>
          <p class="indent">CSI Colorist Society International

          color correction. ColoristSociety.com</p>
          <p class="indent">Code Values Discrete values for 8, 10,
          12 or 16 bit integer encodings. For example, a 10 bit
          image has 1024 code values, numbering from 0 to 1023.</p>
          <p class="indent">Color Management Techniques used to
          ensure that the intended appearance of an image is
          reproduced in the same way everywhere it is viewed. This
          may include Color Appearance Modeling to account for
          differences in viewing environment and display
          brightness, or may simply ensure identical absolute
          display colorimetry on all displays (within the
          limitations of a particular display).</p>
          <p class="indent">Digital Intermediate (DI) The process
          of manipulating color and other characteristics of
          digital images prior to theatrical release. DI is
          currently used for both film and video markets and uses
          software with a data workflow rather than hardware and a
          tape-based pipeline. The term was originally used by
          Kodak to define a workflow from film negatives to digital
          manipulation and back to film. (from
          http://www.finalcolor.com/glossary-1/). It is commonly
          used in VFX to mean color grading and finishing, which is
          a narrower definition than the term originally intended
          but is the preferred meaning in this document.</p>
          <p class="indent">Defocus The optical effect caused by
          light rays converging in front of or behind the plane of
          the sensor in a camera. Simulated in post by convolving
          the image with a kernel with the same shape as the lens
          iris, and size proportional to the desired defocus.</p>

          <p class="indent">D65 The CIE standard daylight
          illuminant (approximately 6504K, although not actually on
          the Planckian locus) used as the white point for
          televisions, HD video monitors and most computer
          displays. The CIE defines the chromaticity coordinates of
          D65 as (0.31272, 0.32903) but Rec. 709 and many other
          color encoding specifications use a form rounded to four
          decimal places.</p>
          <p class="indent">EDL (Edit Decision List) Text file used
          to convey the shots used in a cut, and their positions in
          the timeline, between different editing and grading
          systems. Historically EDLs were used to transfer edits
          from non-linear offline editing systems (and before that
          tape based offlines) to the high quality multi-machine
          tape editing systems. Various forms exist, but the most
          commonly used are based on the CMX3600 format.</p>
          <p class="indent">EOTF (Electro-Optical Transfer
          Function) The mathematical mapping between the
          output-referred pixel values and the luminance on a
          particular display.</p>
          <p class="indent">Encoding gamut The gamut chosen by a
          camera manufacturer for use in mapping the specific
          response from their sensor and filter’s spectral response
          curves to chromaticities.</p>
          <p class="indent">Gamut The range of colors able to be
          represented by positive values in a particular color
          encoding. Gamuts are often shown as triangles on a CIE xy
          or u*v* plot, but these, in fact, are only a projection
          of the volume of the color gamut, as the luminance
          component is not shown.</p>
          <p class="indent">HDR (High Dynamic Range) HDR has
          multiple meanings: It is a set of techniques that allow a
          greater dynamic range of exposures or values (i.e. a
          wider range of values between light and dark areas) to be
          handled than normal digital imaging techniques. HDR image
          capture encodes a wider than normal dynamic range from
          the scene, without applying any tone mapping or other
          processing to make the result suitable for direct
          display. This may be done either by combining multiple
          bracketed exposures from a lower dynamic range device, or
          by using a camera which has an inherently high dynamic
          range. HDR image processing is the most common usage in
          this document and within the VFX community. It is used to
          mean working with wide dynamic range scene referred data
          in a manner which preserves the dynamic range, either by
          using unclamped floating point linear processing, or a
          logarithmic representation of the linear image data. HDR
          display is a set of new technologies which use screen
          brightness significantly greater than conventional
          displays. These displays use either a Perceptual
          Quantizer (PQ/ ST.2084) or Hybrid Log Gamma (HLG) EOTF to
          display images. Colorists, consumers, and distributors
          are likely to mean HDR displays when they use the term
          HDR. Note: The term HDR is also used to refer to images
          which use local tone mapping to prepare a high dynamic
          range image for a standard dynamic range display,
          producing the unnatural looking images often seen online.
          This document does not ever use the term in that
          sense.</p>
          <p class="indent">HLG (Hybrid Log Gamma) HDR encoding
          developed by the BBC and NHK, and specified in ITU-R
          BT.2100, which defines an OETF and EOTF, producing a
          system gamma OOTF. Unlike ST.2084, HLG is a relative
          standard, with output brightness dependent on the black
          and white levels of the display.</p>
          <p class="indent">IDT see Input Transform</p>
          <p class="indent">Input Transform Transform provided by a
          camera manufacturer, or specified by A.M.P.A.S, to map a
          source encoding to ACES2065-1.</p>
          <p class="indent">IRE While strictly a unit of
          measurement of the voltage in composite video signals,
          the term IRE is commonly used to refer to the level of
          any signal between black and white as a percentage, with
          0 IRE being black and 100 IRE white. It is often used to
          abstract the encoded signal from the code values used to
          represent it, so in "Legal Range" 0 IRE is 10 bit 64 and
          100 IRE is 940. In "Full Range" 0 IRE is 0 and 100 IRE is
          1023.</p>
          <p class="indent">Look Management Techniques used to
          communicate the intended appearance of an image,
          including creative as well as technical transforms, so
          that the same Look can be seen by all involved.</p>

          perceptually uniform hue, value (lightness) and
          chroma.</p>
          <p class="indent">NTSC (National Television System
          Committee) Organization in the US founded to standardize
          the format for television broadcasts. Commonly used to
          refer to the color television standard defined by that
          committee. NTSC is a standard definition interlaced
          format with 29.97 frames (59.94 fields) per second, but
          the term is often loosely used to refer to any 30 or
          29.97 fps video format, to distinguish it from formats
          based on the European PAL 25 frames (50 fields) per
          second system. The precise frame rate is in fact 30 ?

          <p class="indent">OOTF (Optical to Optical Transfer
          Function) The mathematical mapping used to convert

          for the purposes of picture rendering.</p>
          <p class="indent">Output-referred image state Image state
          associated with image data that represents the
          colorimetry of the elements of an image that has
          undergone color rendering appropriate for a specified
          real or virtual output device and viewing conditions.</p>
          <p class="indent">Output Transform The ACES term for what
          is also called a Display Transform, a mathematical
          mapping which transforms scene-referred image data into
          display-referred, targeting a particular class of
          display. This transform is not purely colorimetric, but
          includes tone mapping and picture rendering.</p>
          <p class="indent">Picture rendering A modification of the

          <p class="indent">PQ (Perceptual Quantizer aka Perceptual
          Quantisation) EOTF standardized by SMPTE ST.2084 for HDR
          displays. PQ is an output referred absolute encoding of
          HDR display luminance, covering the range from 0 to
          10,000 cd/m2. Originally designed by Dolby under the name
          PQ for Perceptual Quantizer, because each PQ code value
          increment represents an equal increase in perceived
          brightness throughout the range. Quantizer and
          Quantization are used interchangeably in discussions
          about PQ. Quantizer was used originally by Dolby, but
          Quantization become more commonly used later on, as in
          the ITU-R BT.2100 document.</p>
          <p class="indent">Rushes Original unmodified files
          recorded by a camera. Historically the term referred to
          the exposed negative or recorded video tape, but the term
          is now used to refer either to the files on the camera
          media, or a copy of those files made on set or in a data
          lab.</p>
          <p class="indent">Scene-referred image state Image state
          associated with image data that represents estimates of
          the colorimetry of the elements of a scene.
          Scene-referred image data typically represents relative
          scene colorimetry estimates. Absolute scene colorimetry
          estimates may be calculated using a scaling factor.</p>
          <p class="indent">SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) Term used
          to describe display systems not capable of high dynamic
          range; normally used in contrast to HDR displays. Also
          used to describe output-referred image data restricted to
          the 0-1 range (or integer equivalent) suitable for
          display on SDR displays.</p>
          <p class="indent">Small Floats These are floating-point
          representations with fewer bits than the usual 16-bit
          implementations. Overall range is similar to 16-bit since
          the 5-bit exponent is preserved, but a reduced size
          mantissa reduces precision and the sign bit is dropped.
          Links with more information be found in the "Small float
          formats" part of Appendix 4.14.4.</p>

          <p class="indent">Working Space The color space in which
          a particular set of operations is performed. The choice
          of working space has a significant effect on the way such
          operations act. Some spaces may be more appropriate than
          others for certain operations, and some may be entirely
          unsuitable. A color pipeline is likely to use different
          working spaces at different points. They are often
          transient color spaces, existing only within a grading or
          compositing system, with transforms to and from the
          working space applied either side of the operations.</p>
