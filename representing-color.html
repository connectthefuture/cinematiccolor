          Image - Raster Graphics</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">A digital image is a rectangular data
          structure (a 2 or 3-dimensional array) of picture
          elements (pixels).</p>
          <p class="indent">The color of a pixel is determined by a
          single code for achromatic images or multiple codes for
          chromatic images, commonly three.</p>
          <p class="indent">Raster graphics represent color image
          data as a rectangular grid of code triplets.</p>
          <p class="indent">The word code implies that a function
          encoded each pixel color, selecting the appropriate
          function depends on many factors and requires the
          introduction of concepts such as color encodings, image
          states, quantization or perceptual coding.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">2.6.2</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-20-68" id=
          "x20-670002.6.2">Quantization</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Quantization is the process of
          mapping a continuous input signal (or sizeable discrete
          set of input values) to a smaller discrete set of output
          values (or codes). Quantization is ubiquitous in digital
          image processing and used to reduce images storage
          requirements through file size reduction or to lower
          bandwidth requirements when streaming images.</p>
          <p class="indent">During quantization, the information
          between each quantizer step is discarded and
          irretrievably lost which makes it a lossy compression
          technique. The difference between the input value and the
          code value is known as the quantization error or signal
          distortion.</p>
          <p class="indent">4-bit quantization of a continuous
          sinusoidal signal, there are 24==16 quantizer steps.</p>
          <p class="indent">Quantization error decreases the
          signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which in the context of
          digital imaging typically creates banding and contouring
          artifacts. They can be reduced by introducing a small
          amount of noise (? ? quantizer step) before the
          quantization, this is called dithering, and even though
          it also reduces the SNR, the noise introduced by
          dithering is usually more compelling than banding
          artifacts, although it may increase the required
          bandwidth for compressed deliverables.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">2.6.3</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-20-69" id="x20-680002.6.3">Perceptual
          Coding</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">As Poynton (1998) explains, a color
          imaging system is perceptually uniform if a small
          perturbation of a component value is approximately
          equally perceptible across the range of that value.</p>
          <p class="indent">Most electronic color imaging systems
          account for the non-linearity of the HVS and its
          logarithmic perceptual response to brightness when
          encoding RGB scene relative luminance values
          (linear-light values) into R’G’B’ perceptually uniform
          values using an OETF. The encoding process makes the
          reduction of bandwidth and the number of bits required
          per pixel possible by optimizing digital codes allocation
          as described in the next section.</p>
          <p class="indent">Comparing 4 bit linear and perceptually
          uniform quantization of an image. Image copyright ?
          Disney 2018</p>
          <p class="indent">Old cathode ray tube (CRTs) displays’
          electron gun characteristics imposed an EOTF that is
          approximately the inverse of the HVS perception of
          brightness. The combination of HVS perceptual response to
          brightness with the CRT power function produces code
          values displayed in a perceptually uniform way.
          Non-linear coding was well understood by the engineers
          who designed the NTSC television system and was necessary
          to achieve good visual performance. Modern Standard
          Dynamic Range (SDR) display devices, e.g. Liquid Crystal
          Display (LCD), plasma, and Digital Light Processing
          (DLP), replicate this behavior by imposing a 2.2, 2.4 or
          2.6 power function through signal processing circuitry.
          Their response to the input signal is often reasonably
          modeled using a gain-offset-gamma (GOG)
          approximation.</p>
          <p class="indent">L = (gain ? V + offset)? where L is the
          normalized luminance emitted from the display, V is the
          normalized input device code value, and ? is the Gamma
          exponent and is discussed in details in section
          2.5.5.</p>
          <p class="indent">As described in section 2.2.6, an
          increment in Luminance is judged relative to the previous
          amount. The difference between a Luminance value L and a
          Luminance value L + ?L is noticeable for ?L &gt;
          &nbsp;0.01L. In other words, the
          just-noticeable-difference (JND) between two Luminance
          values is about 1</p>
          <p class="indent">The 1.01 (101 / 100) ratio is known as
          the Weber contrast or Weber fraction. On a linear-light
          values scale from code 0 to code 255, code 100 is the
          location where the Weber contrast reaches 1An ideal
          non-linear transfer function allocates code values to
          minimize the just-noticeable difference. Advanced
          approaches, e.g. DICOM GSDF and PQ, account for the
          spatial frequency behavior of the HVS and leverage Barten
          (2003) Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) to model
          almost optimal functions.</p>

          various Weber contrast values. Poynton, C. (2012).

          Interfaces (2nd ed.). Elsevier / Morgan Kaufmann.
          ISBN:978-0123919267</p>
          <p class="indent">The contrast ratio is the ratio between
          the lowest luminance (reference black) and the highest
          luminance (reference white) that an electronic color
          imaging system is capable of producing. The artifact
          devoid contrast ratio is the ratio between the lowest
          luminance value that can be reproduced without artifacts
          (code 100 on a linear system) and the peak luminance of
          the system.</p>
          <p class="indent">For 8 bit linear-light code values, the
          artifact devoid contrast ratio is only 2.55:1 (255 /
          100). The "code 100" problem as Poynton (2003) terms it,
          can be addressed by using 12 bit coding (4095 code
          values) yielding an artifact devoid contrast ratio of
          40.95:1, however, most of those codes cannot be visually
          discriminated.</p>
          <p class="indent">On the other hand, using a logarithmic
          or power based perceptual coding, the required number of
          code values can be dramatically reduced, for example
          maintaining a 1.01 Weber contrast over scene relative
          luminance range of [0.01, 100] (contrast ratio of 100:1),
          requires approximately 462 codes (? 9 bits).</p>
          <p class="indent">Perceptual coding is not required when
          using 16 bit integer (artifacts free contrast ratio of
          655.35:1) or half float-representations (Weber contrast
          of 0.1</p>

          Representations</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Integer representations are not
          appropriate for storing linear high-dynamic range
          scene-referred imagery due to the typical luminance
          distribution in real-world scenes, even when they are
          middle-grey normalized. Floating-point systems gracefully
          address the precision issues associated with encoding
          scene-referred linear imagery. They represent numbers
          approximately to a fixed number of significant digits,
          i.e. the significand, scaled by an exponent in some fixed
          base, e.g. 2, 10 or 16.</p>
          <p class="indent">The same unit can represent different
          orders of magnitude, for example, the temperature of the
          cosmic microwave background radiation is -270.45 ?C while
          the quasar 3C273 temperature has been estimated to 10
          trillion ?C. Whereas with integer representations, the
          interval between two consecutive values is the same
          throughout the domain, with floating point
          representations the intervals increase as the exponent
          does. Fractional values can be represented using a
          negative exponent, and one bit is reserved to indicate
          the sign, allowing the coding of negative values as well.

          often lies firmly towards performance, smaller floating
          point formats dropping the sign bit or having less
          precision (or both) are common. For more information on
          these, please refer to sections 3.4.3, 3.4.4.1 and 3.5.3.
          For storage and performance reasons, it is common to
          encode high-dynamic range, scene-referred color spaces
          with integer representations. Digital motion picture
          cameras often record 10 or 12 bit integer media, e.g.
          ProRes, X-AVC, HDCAM SR or DPX files using an integer
          logarithmic encoding. It allows for most of the benefits
          of floating point representations, without actually
          requiring floating-point storage media. Being integer,
          logarithmic image data is also suitable for transporting
          over SDI. In logarithmic encodings, successive code
          values in the integer log space map to multiplicative
          values in linear space. Put more intuitively, this is
          analogous to converting each pixel to a representation of
          the number of stops above or below a reference level, and
          then storing an integer representation of this
          quantity.</p>
          <p class="indent">As logarithmic images encode an
          extensive dynamic range, most mid-tone pixels reside in
          the central portion of the encoded scale. Thus, if you
          directly display a logarithmic image on a sRGB monitor,
          it exhibits low contrast.</p>

          <p class="noindent">Gamma (?) is a numerical parameter
          giving the exponent of a power function assumed to
          approximate the relationship between a signal quantity
          (such as a video signal code) and light power.</p>
          <p class="indent">Encoding gamma (?E), characteristic of
          OETFs uses an exponent approximately between 0.4 and 0.5
          while decoding gamma (?D), characteristic of EOTFs uses
          an exponent approximately between 2.2 and 2.6.</p>
          <p class="indent">The various gamma values are usually
          dependent on the color imaging systems and their defined
          viewing conditions. A color imaging system achieves
          representation of a scene in a way that matches viewer
          expectation of the appearance of that scene instead of
          attempting to reproduce physical color stimuli
          quantities. An outdoor sunlight scene can have luminance
          over 50,000 cd/m2 but may be displayed on a consumer
          electronic display with a white peak luminance of 320
          cd/m2.</p>

          <p class="indent">As described in 2.5.3 Color Appearance
          Phenomena, the Lateral-Brightness Adaptation Effect (by
          virtue of the surround change) and the Steven Effect (by
          virtue of the display device peak luminance depending on
          the viewing conditions) will affect the perceived image
          contrast and is critical to the faithful reproduction of
          images in the home or theater viewing conditions.</p>
          <p class="indent">A simple but efficient way to
          compensate for the different surrounds, viewing
          conditions and display peak luminance when exhibiting
          pictures is to increase their contrast as the viewing
          conditions get darker. Typically, the surround brightness
          and the display peak luminance will be lower as well.
          Hunt (2004) reports that to overcome the loss in apparent
          contrast, the end-to-end system function or Opto-Optical
          Transfer Function (OOTF) for a digital color imaging
          system may have appropriate the, controversial, exponent
          values of 1, 1.25, and 1.5 respectively for bright, dim,
          and dark surrounds. The surround effect is likely
          overpredicted when those values are used in color
          appearance models to transform image lightness contrast
          based on the relative luminance of the surround. Daniels,
          Giorgianni and Fairchild (1997) report exponent values of
          1, 1.06, and 1.16 as general guidelines. Gamma and its
          correction on a system, the combination of the different
          encoding and decoding gammas yields an end-to-end (OOTF)
          system gamma which increases perceived image
          contrast.</p>

          <p class="noindent">A color encoding is a digital
          representation of colors for image processing, storage,
          and interchange between systems. Madden and Giorgianni
          (2007) define it as the numerical specification of color
          information.</p>
          <p class="indent">A color encoding specification (CES) is
          a fully specified color encoding scheme and must define
          both the following components:</p>
          <p class="indent">Color Encoding Method determining the
          meaning of the encoded data or what will be represented
          by the data. Color Encoding Data Metric characterizing
          the color space and the numerical units used to encode
          the data or how the representation will be numerically
          expressed. It may also include the specification for data
          file format, data compression method and other relevant
