          Colorimetry</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">In the late 19th century, Young and
          Helmholtz proposed that color vision is conveyed through
          a limited number of receptors sensitive to different
          portions of the visible spectrum. Maxwell (1860) used
          linear algebra to prove Young–Helmholtz trichromatic
          theory and invented color matching experiments and modern
          colorimetry. The trichromatic theory explains the
          metamerism phenomenon: two samples matching under some
          lighting conditions might look different under
          others.</p>
          <p class="indent">Hering proposed the opponent color
          theory around 1920 to explain phenomena not accounted for
          by the trichromatic theory. He noted that specific pairs
          of colors did not occur at the same time and place: a
          reddish-green or yellowish-blue. We, however, do see
          reddish-yellows and greenish-blues. He thought there were
          three receptor types with bipolar response to red-green,
          yellow-blue, and light-dark.</p>
          <p class="indent">The Modern Opponent Colors Theory with
          a trichromatic first stage mediated by the cones and
          opponent colors encoding in the second stage. Stockman,

          <p class="indent">The modern color vision theory,
          foundational basis of colorimetry, combines both
          Young–Helmholtz’s Trichromatic Theory and Hering’s
          Opponent Colors Theory: Color vision in the first stage
          is trichromatic and executed by the cone cells. In the
          second stage, upper retinal layers encode the cone cells
          signals into an achromatic signal V() = L + M and two
          cone opponent chromatic signals such as RG = L - M, YB =
          L + M - S. 2.3.2 Measuring Light The CIE defines
          colorimetry as the measurement of color stimuli based on
          a set of conventions. Electromagnetic radiation
          measurements are performed with instruments such as
          spectroradiometers, spectrophotometers, or tristimulus
          colorimeters for the case of visible radiation.</p>
          <p class="indent">Spectroradiometry and spectrophotometry
          need to be described as their naming with regard to
          radiometry and photometry can be confusing.
          Spectroradiometry measures the amount of light radiated
          as a function of wavelength, i.e. radiance, or
          irradiated, i.e. irradiance. Spectrophotometry measures
          the amount of light reflected, transmitted, or absorbed
          as a function of wavelength, i.e. reflectance, or
          transmitted, i.e. transmittance. Both disciplines measure
          a radiometric quantity (radiant flux) and not a
          photometric one contrary to what the spectrophotometry
          name might imply. Spectroradiometers, measuring radiance
          or irradiance, and spectrophotometers, measuring
          reflectance or transmittance, produce spectral
          distributions with a narrowband interval, e.g. 1nm, 5nm
          or 10nm.</p>
          <p class="indent">On the other hand, tristimulus
          colorimeters use red, green and blue filters that emulate
          the HVS spectral response to light. They produce a single
          triplet of values by measuring wideband radiant energy
          and are used in digital imaging to calibrate displays.
          Because they mimic the HVS, tristimulus colorimeters are
          also subject to the metamerism phenomenon.</p>

          Radiation, Light sources and Illuminants</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">All ordinary matter emits
          electromagnetic radiation when its temperature is above
          absolute zero. Even black holes are predicted to emit
          Hawking radiation, a form of blackbody radiation caused
          by the creation of sub-atomic particles near the event
          horizon.</p>
          <p class="indent">A blackbody or Planckian radiator is an
          ideal thermal radiator that absorbs all incident
          radiation, disregarding the wavelength, the direction of
          incidence or the polarization completely. In thermal
          equilibrium, it emits electromagnetic radiation
          (blackbody radiation) with a characteristic spectral
          distribution that depends only on its temperature and is
          given by Planck’s Law.</p>
          <p class="indent">When their temperature increases past
          750 Kelvin, blackbodies start to emit visible
          electromagnetic radiation, i.e. light.</p>
          <p class="indent">Various blackbody spectral power
          distributions in temperature domain 1250-10000K, note how
          their radiation peak slides into the visible spectrum
          range as their temperature increase.</p>
          <p class="indent">Blackbodies are fundamental to both
          astronomy and color science allowing one to determine the
          color of a thermal radiator knowing only its temperature.
          Conversely, its temperature can be computed from its
          color. In 1931, using Planck’s Law, the CIE was able to
          unambiguously and mathematically describe a standard
          tungsten light source: the CIE Standard Illuminant A with
          a color temperature of 2856K.</p>
          <p class="indent">ASTM G-173 ETR Extraterrestrial
          Radiation (solar spectrum at top of atmosphere) at mean
          Earth-Sun distance compared to a Blackbody at 5778K. The
          differences between the curves are mostly explained by
          the fact that the Sun is not a perfect blackbody. The
          Sun, principal light source on Earth with an effective
          surface temperature of 5,778K, is close to an ideal
          thermal radiator. Its spectrum exhibits numerous
          absorption and emission spectral lines, i.e. the
          Fraunhofer lines, resulting from the interactions of
          atoms, atom nuclei, and molecules with photons in its
          atmosphere. The Sun is not a solid body and has multiple
          layers with different temperatures: corona, chromosphere,
          photosphere, convective zone, radiative zone, and core.
          The photosphere, the layer of gas constituting the
          visible surface of the Sun, is the principal source of
          the radiation we receive and the region where most of the
          aforementioned spectral lines are forming. When solar
          radiation traverses the Earth atmosphere, it interacts
          with it, producing absorption, emission and scattering
          events that further modify its spectrum.</p>
          <p class="indent">Profile image of the daylight spectrum
          captured with a DIY spectroscope and a CANON 5D Mark II
          DSLR camera. Major Fraunhofer Lines are annotated for
          reference. The black curve represents the luminance of
          the spectrum at each wavelength. The white curve is a
          reference spectrum concurrently captured with an Ocean
          Optics STS-VIS spectrometer. While the spectroscope has a
          very high resolution, the overall curve shape is
          dramatically different to that of the spectrometer one:
          the DSLR spectral sensitivities, its infrared filter, and
          reflections in the spectroscope tube are all contributing
          to alter the curve, making it unsuitable for precise
          measurements. CIE Illuminants B and C were intended to
          respectively model noon sunlight (correlated color
          temperature (CCT) of 4874K) and average daylight (CCT of
          6774K). They are realised by combining a light source
          modeling CIE Standard Illuminant A with Davis-Gibson
          liquid filters from David and Gibson (1931). Because of
          the low illuminance levels achieved with such light
          sources and their poor performance in the
          near-ultraviolet region (which is essential for
          fluorescent materials), they were deprecated in favor of
          the CIE Illuminant D Series created by Judd, MacAdam, and
          Wyszecki (1964).</p>
          <p class="indent">The CIE Illuminant D Series models a
          broad range of daylight phases inclusive of direct
          sunlight, sunlight with cloud coverage, full overcast
          coverage, and blue skylight. For standardization
          purposes, ”CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D65 should be
          used in all colorimetric calculations requiring
          representative daylight unless there are specific reasons
          for using a different illuminant” (ISO
          11664-2:2007(E)/CIES014-2/E:2006).</p>
          <p class="indent">CIE Illuminants B, C, and CIE Standard
          Illuminant D Series D65. Note how the CIE Illuminants B
          and C curves are different to the CIE Standard Illuminant
          D Series D65 curve in the 300nm-380nm near-ultraviolet
          region. From a terminology standpoint, it is meaningful
          to understand that illuminants and light sources are
          different: An illuminant is a standardized table of
          values or mathematical function representing an ideal
          light source. A light source is a physical emitter of
          visible radiant energy.</p>

          <p class="noindent">Emitted light interacts with surfaces
          of the world and is either reflected, transmitted or
          absorbed. The measured radiant flux is the summation of
          the light reflection, transmission, and absorption at
          each wavelength such as: () = R() + T() + A() where () is
          the measured radiant flux, R(), T() and A() are
          respectively the surface reflectance, transmittance, and
          absorptance. They are ordinarily expressed as fractions
          of () in range 0-1.</p>
          <p class="indent">Clover leaf reflectance, transmittance,
          and absorptance spectra from LOPEX93, note that the
          wavelengths represented are purposely reaching
          near-infrared: even though invisible, the spectra have
          values in that portion and exhibit a lot of variation.
          Because they are also a function of the illumination and
          viewing geometry, i.e. the angle between the light
          incident at the surface and the angle of the instrument,
          a complete description requires capturing the
          Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) or
          Bidirectional Transmittance Distribution Function (BTDF).
          High-quality BxDF data capture is not only difficult, but
          its usage is also non-trivial thus for practical purposes
          the CIE defines 4 standard illuminations and viewing
          geometries. They are described in CIE 015:2004

          energy into CIE XYZ tristimulus values reduces complex
          light color information spanning many wavelengths into
          three sensory quantities. From a mathematical standpoint,
          the tristimulus conversion equations X.X.X are
          demonstrating the phenomenon: the integrals represent the
          area under the multiplied spectral distribution curves of
          the sample, light, and CMFS. However, an infinite number
          of light and sample curve combinations yield the same
          area: tristimulus values are multi-valued, and metamerism
          occurs because of the lack of injectivity. A consequence
          of this reduction is that two samples viewed under the
          same illumination conditions can produce an identical
          cone cells response and thus yield matching CIE XYZ
          tristimulus values. The two samples are said to be
          metamers, and changing the illumination conditions might
          result into a metameric failure: this is the metamerism
          phenomenon.</p>
          <p class="indent">Metameric failure example, the two

          L*t)2 + (a*r - a*t)2 + (b*r - b*t)2) where ΔE*76 is the
          color difference, L*r, a*r, b*r , and L*t, a*t, b*t are
          the reference and test color sample.</p>
          <p class="indent">While the CIE L*a*b* color space
          features decent perceptual uniformity, it was deemed
          unsatisfactory when comparing some pair of colors,
          compelling the CIE into improving the metric with the CIE
          1994 (ΔE*94) and subsequent CIE 2000 (ΔE*00)
          quasimetrics. It is appropriate to measure color
          differences in the CAM16-UCS, ICtCp and JzAzBz color
          spaces using Euclidean distance.</p>

          RGB Color Spaces</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Additive RGB color spaces are the
          color representation that most people interact with on a
          daily basis; our display technology is based on the
          additive mixing of 3 red, green and blue primaries.</p>
          <p class="indent">The first RGB color space, CIE RGB, was
          created by Wright Guild (1931) when they performed their
          color matching experiments. The three monochromatic
          primary colors R, G, B used to match a test color at a
          single wavelength of light once plotted on the CIE 1931
          Chromaticity Diagram, are located on the spectral locus
          and respectively have the following wavelengths: 700.0
          nm, 546.1 nm, and 435.8 nm. sRGB is the ubiquitous RGB
          color space created by Hewlett Packard and Microsoft in
          1996, standardized as IEC 61966-2-1:1999, in an attempt
          to define a standard color space for use with monitors,
          printers, and on the Internet. Many other RGB color
          spaces exist and are reviewed in the Appendix. This
          section of the document focuses instead on the components
          of an RGB color space and provides some disambiguation of
          terminology.</p>
          <p class="indent">It is common to see operators in
          digital content creation (DCC) applications or functions
          in various game engines, libraries, color processing
          tools labeled as ”linear to sRGB”. The consequence of
          poor wording is that people often don’t understand that
          sRGB is probably more than a ”linear to sRGB” operator or
          function. Some resources purport to explain how sRGB and
          linear color spaces differ. First and foremost, while the
          CIE RGB and sRGB color space gamuts are intrinsically
          representing radiometrically linear light values, their
          color component transfer functions are radically
          different: CIE RGB has no defined encoding and decoding
          color component transfer functions; they are considered
          to be linear; however sRGB adopts non-linear color
          encoding and decoding component transfer functions
          following a power law.</p>
          <p class="indent">The confusion comes from the fact that
          generally, people don’t mention which component of the
          additive RGB color space they are referring to. The
          following three components are required to fully specify
          an additive RGB color space:</p>
          <p class="indent">Primaries White point Color Component
          Transfer Functions</p>
          <p class="indent">Noticeably, the ISO 22028-1:2016
          Standard defines an additive RGB color space as
          follows:</p>
          <p class="indent">Additive RGB color space</p>
          <p class="indent">Colorimetric color space having three
          color primaries (generally red, green and blue) such that
          CIE XYZ tristimulus values can be determined from the RGB
          color space values by forming a weighted combination of
          the CIE XYZ tristimulus values for the individual color
          primaries, where the weights are proportional to the
          radiometrically linear color space values for the
          corresponding color primaries.</p>
          <p class="indent">Note 1 to entry: A simple linear 3
          <span class="cmsy-10">×</span> 3 matrix transformation
          can be used to transform between CIE XYZ tristimulus
          values and the radiometrically linear color space values
          for an additive RGB color space.</p>
          <p class="indent">Note 2 to entry: Additive RGB color
          spaces are defined by specifying the CIE chromaticity
          values for a set of additive RGB primaries and a color
          space white point, together with a color component
          transfer function.</p>

          id="x18-450002.4.8">Primaries</a></h5>
          <p class="noindent">The primaries’ chromaticity
          coordinates define the gamut that can be encoded by a
          given RGB color space. It is essential to understand that
          while commonly represented as triangles on a Chromaticity
          Diagram, RGB color space gamuts define the boundaries of
          an actual 3D volume within the CIE xyY color space. The
          shape of the volume is not simply an extruded triangle
          because each primary reaches unity at a different
          luminance value. From that point the luminance can only
          rise by increasing one or both of the other channels, and
          consequently decreasing saturation. Maximum luminance is
          only achieved when the three channels reach unity, which
          corresponds to the achromatic point at the top of the
          volume. A gamut, per definition, only contains physically
          realizable colors but RGB color space primaries can be
          located outside of the spectral locus, in such cases, the
          gamut is the intersection between the given RGB color
          space volume and the volume of physically realizable
          colors.</p>
          <p class="indent">sRGB color space gamut visualized in
          CIE xyY color space. The shape of the volume is the
          result of the transformation of an RGB unit cube to CIE
          XYZ color space followed by a transformation to CIE xyY
          color space.</p>
          <p class="indent">sRGB, DCI-P3 and BT.2020 RGB color

          <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a href="#x18-460002.4.8"
          id="x18-460002.4.8">White Point</a></h5>
          <p class="noindent">The white point is defined by the CIE
          as the ”achromatic reference stimulus in a chromaticity
          diagram that corresponds to the stimulus that produces an
          image area that has the perception of white”. Any colors
          lying on the neutral axis line defined by the white point
          and its vertical projection toward the bottom of the RGB
          color space gamut, no matter their Luminance, are neutral
          to that RGB color space and thus achromatic.</p>
          <p class="indent">Various RGB color spaces white points
          in the CIE 1960 UCS chromaticity diagram, note that the
          ACES white point is not precisely equal to CIE Illuminant
          D Series D60.</p>
          <p class="indent">Typical white points are chosen as CIE
          Standard Illuminants. In 1953, the National Television
          System Committee (NTSC) published a standard for color
          television that used CIE Illuminant C. As noted in
          section 2.3.3, CIE Illuminant C was superseded by the CIE
          Standard Illuminant D Series D65 and became the
          illuminant for the PAL and SECAM analog encoding systems
          for color television in the 1960s. In the 1990s, desktop
          publishing CRT color monitors often adopted a white point
          close to CCT 9300 K which was deemed too high by the
          professional printing industry and graphic arts to
          suitably soft proof images. Printing workflows use CIE
          Illuminant D Series D50 (ISO 3664:1975) as it is
          somewhere between average daylight and incandescent
          light. CIE Illuminant D Series D50 is the illuminant
          adopted by the International Color Consortium (ICC)
          established in 1993 by eight imaging companies ”for the
          purpose of creating, promoting and encouraging the
          standardization and evolution of an open, vendor-neutral,
          cross-platform color management architecture and
          components.”</p>
          <p class="indent">Two white points were suggested as an
          alternative to the high CRT CCT: CIE Illuminant D Series
          D50 and CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D65. Images
          displayed on monitors calibrated to CIE Illuminant D
          Series D50 were deemed dull and yellow in dim to average
          viewing conditions.</p>
          <p class="indent">Following on from PAL and SECAM color
          television, and also as a consequence of the broad
          adoption of the sRGB IEC 61966-2-1:1999 standard, most
          modern computer display systems use CIE Standard
          Illuminant D Series D65.</p>
          <p class="indent">Digital cinema as per the
          recommendation of the Digital Cinema Initiative (DCI)
          adopts the DCI-P3 white point based on a Xenon arc lamp
          spectral power distribution. ACES uses a white point
          close to CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D60: its lower
          CCT makes it more pleasing for dark viewing conditions
          typical of theatrical exhibition.</p>

          Standard generally perform the mapping between linear

          value, most of the time for coding optimization and

          uniformity of a color space.</p>

          <p class="indent">sRGB, Rec. 709 and Cineon Encoding
          color Component Transfer Functions, note how the Cineon
          curve imposes a substantial compression to the input
          domain allowing it to encode a wider dynamic range.</p>
          <p class="indent">Typical OETFs are expressed by a power
          function with an exponent between 0.4 and 0.5. They can
          also be defined as piece-wise functions such as the sRGB
          or Rec. 709 OETFs. OETFs are necessary for the faithful
          representation of images and perceptual coding in
          relation to display non-linear response and the
          non-linearity of the human visual system.</p>
          <p class="indent">Digital cinema cameras usually adopt
          logarithmic encoding functions such as Sony S-Log, ALEXA
          LogC or Canon C-Log allowing storage of a much wider
          dynamic range from the original scene compared to a
          generic Rec. 709 HDTV camera. To some degree, they are
          considered as flavors of the Cineon encoding found in the
          Kodak Cineon System, an early 1990s computer-based
          digital film system. The main difference between digital
          cinema cameras encodings and Cineon is that the latter is
          a logarithmic encoding directly corresponding to the
          optical density of the film negative. In order to know
          the relationship between a Cineon encoding and scene
          light, it is necessary also to know the characteristic
