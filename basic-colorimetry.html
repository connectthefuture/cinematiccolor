<p class="noindent">In the late 19th century, Young and Helmholtz proposed that color vision is conveyed
through a limited number of receptors sensitive to different portions of the visible
spectrum. Maxwell (1860) used linear algebra to prove Young-Helmholtz trichromatic
theory and invented color matching experiments and modern colorimetry. The
trichromatic theory explains the metamerism phenomenon: two samples matching under
some lighting conditions might look different under others.
</p><p class="indent">   Hering proposed the opponent color theory around 1920 to explain phenomena not
accounted for by the trichromatic theory. He noted that specific pairs of colors did not
occur at the same time and place: a reddish-green or yellowish-blue. We, however, do see
reddish-yellows and greenish-blues. He thought there were three receptor types with
bipolar response to red-green, yellow-blue, and light-dark.
</p><p class="indent">   The modern color vision theory, foundational basis of colorimetry, combines both
Young-Helmholtz’s Trichromatic Theory and Hering’s Opponent Colors Theory:
Color vision in the first stage is trichromatic and executed by the cone cells.
In the second stage, upper retinal layers encode the cone cells signals into an
achromatic signal V(?) = L + M and two cone opponent chromatic signals
such as RG = L - M, YB = L + M - S. 2.3.2 Measuring Light The CIE defines
colorimetry as the measurement of color stimuli based on a set of conventions.
Electromagnetic radiation measurements are performed with instruments such as
spectroradiometers, spectrophotometers, or tristimulus colorimeters for the case of visible
radiation.
</p><p class="indent">   Spectroradiometry and spectrophotometry need to be described as their naming with
regard to radiometry and photometry can be confusing. Spectroradiometry measures the
amount of light radiated as a function of wavelength, i.e. radiance, or irradiated, i.e.
irradiance. Spectrophotometry measures the amount of light reflected, transmitted, or
absorbed as a function of wavelength, i.e. reflectance, or transmitted, i.e. transmittance.
Both disciplines measure a radiometric quantity (radiant flux) and not a photometric one
contrary to what the spectrophotometry name might imply. Spectroradiometers,
measuring radiance or irradiance, and spectrophotometers, measuring reflectance or
transmittance, produce spectral distributions with a narrowband interval, e.g. 1nm, 5nm
or 10nm.
</p><p class="indent">   On the other hand, tristimulus colorimeters use red, green and blue filters that
emulate the HVS spectral response to light. They produce a single triplet of values by
measuring wideband radiant energy and are used in digital imaging to calibrate displays.
Because they mimic the HVS, tristimulus colorimeters are also subject to the metamerism
phenomenon.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.4.2   </span> <a href="contents.html#QQ2-18-37" id="x18-360002.4.2">Blackbody Radiation, Light sources and Illuminants</a></h4>
<p class="noindent">All ordinary matter emits electromagnetic radiation when its temperature is above
absolute zero. Even black holes are predicted to emit Hawking radiation, a form of
blackbody radiation caused by the creation of sub-atomic particles near the event
horizon.
</p><p class="indent">   A blackbody or Planckian radiator is an ideal thermal radiator that absorbs all
incident radiation, disregarding the wavelength, the direction of incidence or the
polarization completely. In thermal equilibrium, it emits electromagnetic radiation
(blackbody radiation) with a characteristic spectral distribution that depends only on its
temperature and is given by Planck’s Law.
</p><p class="indent">   When their temperature increases past 750 Kelvin, blackbodies start to emit visible
electromagnetic radiation, i.e. light.
</p><p class="indent">   Various blackbody spectral power distributions in temperature domain 1250-10000K,
note how their radiation peak slides into the visible spectrum range as their temperature
increase.
</p><p class="indent">   Blackbodies are fundamental to both astronomy and color science allowing one to
determine the color of a thermal radiator knowing only its temperature. Conversely,
its temperature can be computed from its color. In 1931, using Planck’s Law,
the CIE was able to unambiguously and mathematically describe a standard
tungsten light source: the CIE Standard Illuminant A with a color temperature of
2856K.
</p><p class="indent">   ASTM G-173 ETR Extraterrestrial Radiation (solar spectrum at top of atmosphere)
at mean Earth-Sun distance compared to a Blackbody at 5778K. The differences between
the curves are mostly explained by the fact that the Sun is not a perfect blackbody. The
Sun, principal light source on Earth with an effective surface temperature of 5,778K, is
close to an ideal thermal radiator. Its spectrum exhibits numerous absorption and
emission spectral lines, i.e. the Fraunhofer lines, resulting from the interactions of atoms,
atom nuclei, and molecules with photons in its atmosphere. The Sun is not a solid body
and has multiple layers with different temperatures: corona, chromosphere, photosphere,
convective zone, radiative zone, and core. The photosphere, the layer of gas
constituting the visible surface of the Sun, is the principal source of the radiation
we receive and the region where most of the aforementioned spectral lines are
forming. When solar radiation traverses the Earth atmosphere, it interacts with it,
producing absorption, emission and scattering events that further modify its
spectrum.
</p><p class="indent">   Profile image of the daylight spectrum captured with a DIY spectroscope and a
CANON 5D Mark II DSLR camera. Major Fraunhofer Lines are annotated for
reference. The black curve represents the luminance of the spectrum at each
wavelength. The white curve is a reference spectrum concurrently captured
with an Ocean Optics STS-VIS spectrometer. While the spectroscope has a
very high resolution, the overall curve shape is dramatically different to that of
the spectrometer one: the DSLR spectral sensitivities, its infrared filter, and
reflections in the spectroscope tube are all contributing to alter the curve, making it
unsuitable for precise measurements. CIE Illuminants B and C were intended
to respectively model noon sunlight (correlated color temperature (CCT) of
4874K) and average daylight (CCT of 6774K). They are realised by combining
a light source modeling CIE Standard Illuminant A with Davis-Gibson liquid
filters from David and Gibson (1931). Because of the low illuminance levels
                                                                  

                                                                  
achieved with such light sources and their poor performance in the near-ultraviolet
region (which is essential for fluorescent materials), they were deprecated in
favor of the CIE Illuminant D Series created by Judd, MacAdam, and Wyszecki
(1964).
</p><p class="indent">   The CIE Illuminant D Series models a broad range of daylight phases inclusive of
direct sunlight, sunlight with cloud coverage, full overcast coverage, and blue skylight.
For standardization purposes, "CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D65 should be used in
all colorimetric calculations requiring representative daylight unless there are specific
reasons for using a different illuminant" (ISO 11664-2:2007(E)/CIES014-2/E:2006).
</p><p class="indent">   CIE Illuminants B, C, and CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D65. Note how the CIE
Illuminants B and C curves are different to the CIE Standard Illuminant D Series
D65 curve in the 300nm-380nm near-ultraviolet region. From a terminology
standpoint, it is meaningful to understand that illuminants and light sources are
different: An illuminant is a standardized table of values or mathematical function
representing an ideal light source. A light source is a physical emitter of visible radiant
energy.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.4.3   </span> <a href="contents.html#QQ2-18-38" id="x18-370002.4.3">Reflectance, Transmittance and Absorptance</a></h4>
<p class="noindent">Emitted light interacts with surfaces of the world and is either reflected, transmitted or
absorbed. The measured radiant flux is the summation of the light reflection,
transmission, and absorption at each wavelength such as: ?(?) = R(?) + T(?) + A(?)
where ?(?) is the measured radiant flux, R(?), T(?) and A(?) are respectively the surface
reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance. They are ordinarily expressed as fractions of
?(?) in range 0-1.
</p><p class="indent">   Clover leaf reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance spectra from LOPEX93, note
that the wavelengths represented are purposely reaching near-infrared: even
though invisible, the spectra have values in that portion and exhibit a lot of
variation. Because they are also a function of the illumination and viewing geometry,
i.e. the angle between the light incident at the surface and the angle of the
instrument, a complete description requires capturing the Bidirectional Reflectance
Distribution Function (BRDF) or Bidirectional Transmittance Distribution Function
(BTDF). High-quality BxDF data capture is not only difficult, but its usage is also
non-trivial thus for practical purposes the CIE defines 4 standard illuminations
and viewing geometries. They are described in CIE 015:2004 Colorimetry, 3rd
Edition.
</p>   
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.4.4   </span> <a href="contents.html#QQ2-18-39" id="x18-380002.4.4">Standard Observers</a></h4>
<p class="noindent">The perception of incident light to the HVS varies from one observer to another. Thus to
avoid ambiguity when characterizing color, the CIE standardized various functions for use
with colorimetric calculations.
</p><p class="indent">   The first one, the CIE 1924 Photopic Standard Observer luminous efficiency function
V(?), a fundamental function modeling the wavelength dependent sensitivity of the HVS,
was established in 1924.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><p class="indent">   V(?) - CIE 1924 Photopic Standard Observer modeling the wavelength dependent
sensitivity of the HVS.
</p><p class="indent">   It was derived for a 2? angular subtense viewing field from several independent
experiments whose results were weight assembled by Gibson and Tyndall (1923).
</p><p class="indent">   The first row shows the computed swatches and spectral distributions of two synthetic
green and red LED lights with equal radiant power. In the second row, the
red LED light luminous flux has been scaled to match that of the green LED
light.
</p><p class="indent">   To an observer viewing a red light and a green light with equal radiant power, the
green light appears brighter than the red: in the above figure their luminous fluxes are
40500lm, and 3500lm respectively. If the red light luminous flux is scaled to match that
of the green light, then both lights are perceived to have similar brightness. The
consequence of this scaling is that the red light radiant power increased by one order of
magnitude.
</p><p class="indent">   Among other factors such as age, color vision sensitivity is affected by the angle
subtended by the objects being observed. In the 1960s it was found that cones were
present in a broader region of the eye than that initially covered by the experiments that
lead to the CIE 1931 2? Standard Observer specification. As a result, color computations
done with the CIE 1931 2? Standard Observer do not always correlate to visual
observation.
</p><p class="indent">   In 1964, the CIE defined an additional standard observer: the CIE 1964 10? Standard
Observer derived from the results of Stiles and Burch (1959) and Speranskaya (1959)
investigations with large-field color matching experiments.
</p><p class="indent">   The CIE 1964 10? Standard Observer corrects some deficiencies of the CIE 1931 2?
Standard Observer, especially in the blue wavelengths. It should be used when dealing
with a field of view of more than 4?.
</p><p class="indent">   The CIE 1964 10? Standard Observer is believed to be a better representation of the
spectral response of human vision and recommended by the CIE when dealing with a field
of view of more than 4?. For example, the CIE 1964 10? Standard Observer is commonly
used in color formulation and color quality control whereas the CIE 1931 2? Standard
Observer tend to be used with applications that deals with small samples or samples
viewed at great distance.
</p><p class="indent">   Virtually all computer graphics applications use the CIE 1931 2? Standard Observer.
Motion picture color management also adopts it as it is suited for computer graphics and
imagery: Interface elements, e.g. icons, color pickers and swatches, and image inner
features tend to be small and subtend a small angle. Hunt (2004) says that "in colour
reproductions, the interest generally lies much more in patches of colour of about
2? angular size than 10?, and the 1931 CIE data may therefore be used with
confidence." The CIE 1931 2? Standard Observer only involves the fovea where
the cones are present, i.e. color vision, and great care was taken to avoid rod
intrusion when the CIE 1964 10? Standard Observer data was assembled with the
consequence that similar care must be taken when evaluating 10? subtending
fields.
</p><p class="indent">   The transition to those new CMFs might happen in the future but there are open
questions on how to migrate dataset that are not spectrally defined, e.g. what are the
chromaticity coordinates of the sRGB color space in the CIE 2012 10? Standard
Observer?

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.4.5   </span> <a href="contents.html#QQ2-18-40" id="x18-390002.4.5">CIE XYZ Tristimulus Values and Metamerism</a></h4>
   
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a href="#x18-400002.4.5" id="x18-400002.4.5">CIE XYZ Tristimulus Values</a></h5>
<p class="noindent">Spectral radiant energy is converted into CIE XYZ tristimulus values by integrating the
product of the spectral distribution of a sample with the spectral power distribution of a
light source (or illuminant) and with the CMFS. Their values for the color of a surface
with spectral reflectance ?(?) under an illuminant of relative spectral power S(?) are
calculated using the following integral equations:
</p><p class="indent">   Equation x.x of the computation of X tristimulus value is illustrated in figure x.x
where the reflectance of a sample of sand is multiplied by CIE Standard Illuminant
D Series D65, the color matching function X? and the normalization factor
k.
</p><p class="indent">   Integration of the spectral reflectance distribution of a sample of sand for X
tristimulus value. Note that this process must be repeated for Y? and Z? shown in
dashed green and blue lines to obtain the corresponding Y and Z tristimulus
values.
</p>   
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a href="#x18-410002.4.5" id="x18-410002.4.5">Metamerism</a></h5>
<p class="noindent">The conversion of spectral radiant energy into CIE XYZ tristimulus values reduces
complex light color information spanning many wavelengths into three sensory quantities.
From a mathematical standpoint, the tristimulus conversion equations X.X.X are
demonstrating the phenomenon: the integrals represent the area under the multiplied
spectral distribution curves of the sample, light, and CMFS. However, an infinite number
of light and sample curve combinations yield the same area: tristimulus values are
multi-valued, and metamerism occurs because of the lack of injectivity. A consequence of
this reduction is that two samples viewed under the same illumination conditions
can produce an identical cone cells response and thus yield matching CIE XYZ
tristimulus values. The two samples are said to be metamers, and changing the
illumination conditions might result into a metameric failure: this is the metamerism
phenomenon.
</p><p class="indent">   Metameric failure example, the two spheres use generated metameric spectral
reflectance distributions that yield matching color under CIE Illuminant E but not under
CIE Standard Illuminant A.

<p class="noindent">It is convenient to use a 2D representation of colors where luminance is separated from
chroma. The CIE xyY color space is constructed through a projective transformation that
isolates the Y luminance axis of the CIE XYZ color space and yields a tuple of
                                                                  

                                                                  
chromaticity coordinates (x, y):
</p><p class="indent">   The CIE 1931 Chromaticity Diagram is a 2D projection of the volume of all the colors
seen by the CIE 1931 2? Standard Observer along the Y luminance axis of the CIE xyY
color space.
</p><p class="indent">   The CIE 1931 Chromaticity Diagram and Pointer (1980)’s Gamut, a gamut of real
surface colors. Note that similarly to the figures showcasing the visible spectrum, the
colors are accurate within the limits of what the display can represent.
</p><p class="indent">   The curved edge encompassing the colors is known as the Spectral Locus and is
composed of physically realizable monochromatic colors, each label on the diagram is
such a color. The encompassed colors are mixtures of the edge monochromatic colors.
The region outside does not correspond to physically-possible colors, those chromaticity
coordinates outside the spectral locus are referred to as "imaginary". They are
often useful for mathematical encoding purposes but are not realizable in any
display system. The line closing the horseshoe shape is known as the line of
purples.
</p><p class="indent">   The volume (or area) of colors either "present in a specific scene, artwork,
photograph, photomechanical, or other reproduction; capable of being created using a
particular output device and/or medium" is defined by the CIE as the color gamut.
Color gamuts are generally represented on the chromaticity diagram as flat,
two-dimensional surfaces with uniform luminance. They are specified with a set of
tuple of chromaticity coordinates (x, y). The chosen luminance value, often 1, is
arbitrary and depends on the use case. For analysis and visualization purposes, it
is valuable to draw multiple variants of a color gamut at different luminance
values as its surface boundary changes accordingly. By extension, color gamuts
such as Pointer (1980)’s gamut of real surface colors, specified with a set of
triplets of CIE xyY color space coordinates are representing three-dimensional
volumes.

<p class="noindent">Although it is not immediately apparent, the chromaticity diagram is a very poor
representation of our color perception. Distances between colors in the CIE xyY
color space do not directly relate to their apparent perceptual differences. Two
adjacent colors may be perceived as different, while colors far apart may be
indistinguishable. The degree to which a given color space accurately maps
geometric distance to perceptual distance is referred to as its level of perceptual
uniformity.
</p><p class="indent">   Perceptual uniformity can be a desirable quality for a color space: it supports accurate
color differences and lightness prediction. A perceptually uniform color space improves
performance of various image processing algorithms such as lossy image compression,
denoising, segmentation or device characterisation, image quality modeling and color
appearance modeling.
</p><p class="indent">   Gamut mapping, the process by which colors lying outside a gamut are mapped inside
it, is preferably performed in a perceptually uniform color space because the correlation
between the perceptual attributes is reduced and thus hue is minimally affected when the
lightness and chroma attributes are individually adjusted to reduce the gamut
size.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><p class="indent">   The non-uniformity of the CIE 1931 Chromaticity Diagram led to the adoption by the
CIE in 1960 of the uniform color space devised by MacAdam (1937). The CIE 1960
Uniform Color Space (UCS) is nowadays primarily used to represent the correlated color
temperature (CCT) of light sources or illuminants as the isolines are perpendicular to the
Planckian locus. The isolines represent delta uv: for a given CCT and its corresponding
color, increasing or decreasing delta uv will bias the color toward green or magenta. The
tint control in white balancing algorithms is effectively delta uv scaled by a
constant.
</p><p class="indent">   CIE 1960 UCS Chromaticity Diagram with Planckian Locus and perpendicular
Iso-Temperature lines.
</p><p class="indent">   Conversion from tristimulus values to CIE 1960 UCS color space UVW values is
performed as follows: UVW = ? ? X, Y, ? ? (-X + 3 ? Y + Z) The chromaticity
coordinates uv are then obtained by a perspective projection similarly to the one of CIE
xyY color space: uv =U / (U + V + W), V / (U + V + W)
</p><p class="indent">   The CIE 1976 UCS Chromaticity Diagram, based on CIE L*u*v* color space,
superseded the CIE 1960 UCS Chromaticity Diagram.
</p><p class="indent">   CIE 1976 UCS Chromaticity Diagram based on CIE L*u*v* color space.
</p><p class="indent">   The conversion from tristimulus values to CIE L*u*v* color space is longer than CIE
1960 UCS and is found in the Appendix. Other uniform color spaces beyond CIE L*u*v*
have been defined: the IPT color space by Ebner and Fairchild (1998) is excellent at
predicting perceived hue. CAM16-UCS by Li, Li, Wang, Zu, Luo, Cui, Melgosa, Brill
and Pointer (2017) is a uniform color space based on CAM16 that offers good
general performance. The ICtCp color space by Lu, Pu, Yin et al. (2016) and the
JzAzBz color space by Safdar, Cui, Kim, and Luo (2017) extend perceptual
uniformity to high dynamic range and adopt the PQ curve as the basis for Lightness
prediction.
</p><p class="indent">   The need for quantifying how much two color samples are different was one of
the incentives for the CIE to design a perceptually uniform color space and
ultimately adopt both the CIE L*a*b* and CIE L*u*v* color spaces in 1976. Color
differences are measured as the Euclidean distance between a reference color
sample and a test color sample in the CIE L*a*b* color space as follows: ?E*76
= ? ((L*r - L*t)2 + (a*r - a*t)2 + (b*r - b*t)2) where ?E*76 is the color
difference, L*r, a*r, b*r , and L*t, a*t, b*t are the reference and test color
sample.
</p><p class="indent">   While the CIE L*a*b* color space features decent perceptual uniformity, it was
deemed unsatisfactory when comparing some pair of colors, compelling the CIE into
improving the metric with the CIE 1994 (?E*94) and subsequent CIE 2000 (?E*00)
quasimetrics. It is appropriate to measure color differences in the CAM16-UCS, ICtCp and
JzAzBz color spaces using Euclidean distance.

<p class="noindent">Additive RGB color spaces are the color representation that most people interact with on
a daily basis; our display technology is based on the additive mixing of 3 red, green and
blue primaries.
</p><p class="indent">   It is common to see operators in digital content creation (DCC) applications or
functions in various game engines, libraries, color processing tools labeled as "linear to
                                                                  

                                                                  
sRGB". The consequence of poor wording is that people often don’t understand that
sRGB is probably more than a "linear to sRGB" operator or function. Some resources
purport to explain how sRGB and linear color spaces differ. First and foremost,
while the CIE RGB and sRGB color space gamuts are intrinsically representing
radiometrically linear light values, their color component transfer functions are radically
different: CIE RGB has no defined encoding and decoding color component transfer
functions; they are considered to be linear; however sRGB adopts non-linear
color encoding and decoding component transfer functions following a power
law.
</p><p class="indent">   The confusion comes from the fact that generally, people don’t mention
which component of the additive RGB color space they are referring to. The
following three components are required to fully specify an additive RGB color
space:
</p><p class="indent">   Primaries White point Color Component Transfer Functions
</p><p class="indent">   Noticeably, the ISO 22028-1:2016 Standard defines an additive RGB color space as
follows:
</p><p class="indent">   Additive RGB color space
</p><p class="indent">   Colorimetric color space having three color primaries (generally red, green and blue)
such that CIE XYZ tristimulus values can be determined from the RGB color space values
by forming a weighted combination of the CIE XYZ tristimulus values for the individual
color primaries, where the weights are proportional to the radiometrically linear color
space values for the corresponding color primaries.
</p><p class="indent">   Note 1 to entry: A simple linear 3 ? 3 matrix transformation can be used to transform
between CIE XYZ tristimulus values and the radiometrically linear color space values for
an additive RGB color space.
</p><p class="indent">   Note 2 to entry: Additive RGB color spaces are defined by specifying the CIE
chromaticity values for a set of additive RGB primaries and a color space white point,
together with a color component transfer function.
</p>   
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a href="#x18-450002.4.8" id="x18-450002.4.8">Primaries</a></h5>
<p class="noindent">The primaries’ chromaticity coordinates define the gamut that can be encoded by a given
RGB color space. It is essential to understand that while commonly represented as
triangles on a Chromaticity Diagram, RGB color space gamuts define the boundaries of
an actual 3D volume within the CIE xyY color space. The shape of the volume is not
simply an extruded triangle because each primary reaches unity at a different
luminance value. From that point the luminance can only rise by increasing one or
both of the other channels, and consequently decreasing saturation. Maximum
luminance is only achieved when the three channels reach unity, which corresponds
to the achromatic point at the top of the volume. A gamut, per definition,
only contains physically realizable colors but RGB color space primaries can be
located outside of the spectral locus, in such cases, the gamut is the intersection
between the given RGB color space volume and the volume of physically realizable
colors.
</p><p class="indent">   sRGB color space gamut visualized in CIE xyY color space. The shape of the volume
is the result of the transformation of an RGB unit cube to CIE XYZ color space followed
by a transformation to CIE xyY color space.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a href="#x18-460002.4.8" id="x18-460002.4.8">White Point</a></h5>
<p class="noindent">The white point is defined by the CIE as the "achromatic reference stimulus in a
chromaticity diagram that corresponds to the stimulus that produces an image area that
has the perception of white". Any colors lying on the neutral axis line defined by the
white point and its vertical projection toward the bottom of the RGB color space
gamut, no matter their Luminance, are neutral to that RGB color space and thus
achromatic.
</p><p class="indent">   Various RGB color spaces white points in the CIE 1960 UCS chromaticity diagram,
note that the ACES white point is not precisely equal to CIE Illuminant D Series
D60.
</p><p class="indent">   Typical white points are chosen as CIE Standard Illuminants. In 1953, the National
Television System Committee (NTSC) published a standard for color television that used
CIE Illuminant C. As noted in section 2.3.3, CIE Illuminant C was superseded by the CIE
Standard Illuminant D Series D65 and became the illuminant for the PAL and SECAM
analog encoding systems for color television in the 1960s. In the 1990s, desktop
publishing CRT color monitors often adopted a white point close to CCT 9300 K which
was deemed too high by the professional printing industry and graphic arts to suitably
soft proof images. Printing workflows use CIE Illuminant D Series D50 (ISO
3664:1975) as it is somewhere between average daylight and incandescent light. CIE
Illuminant D Series D50 is the illuminant adopted by the International Color
Consortium (ICC) established in 1993 by eight imaging companies "for the purpose
of creating, promoting and encouraging the standardization and evolution of
an open, vendor-neutral, cross-platform color management architecture and
components."
</p><p class="indent">   Two white points were suggested as an alternative to the high CRT CCT: CIE
Illuminant D Series D50 and CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D65. Images displayed on
monitors calibrated to CIE Illuminant D Series D50 were deemed dull and yellow in dim
to average viewing conditions.
</p><p class="indent">   Following on from PAL and SECAM color television, and also as a consequence of the
broad adoption of the sRGB IEC 61966-2-1:1999 standard, most modern computer
display systems use CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D65.
</p><p class="indent">   Digital cinema as per the recommendation of the Digital Cinema Initiative (DCI)
adopts the DCI-P3 white point based on a Xenon arc lamp spectral power distribution.
ACES uses a white point close to CIE Standard Illuminant D Series D60: its lower
CCT makes it more pleasing for dark viewing conditions typical of theatrical
exhibition.

The Encoding CCTF, commonly an Opto-Electronic Transfer Function (OETF) or

</p><p class="indent">   sRGB, Rec. 709 and Cineon Encoding color Component Transfer Functions, note how
the Cineon curve imposes a substantial compression to the input domain allowing it to
encode a wider dynamic range.
</p><p class="indent">   Typical OETFs are expressed by a power function with an exponent between 0.4 and
0.5. They can also be defined as piece-wise functions such as the sRGB or Rec. 709
OETFs. OETFs are necessary for the faithful representation of images and perceptual
coding in relation to display non-linear response and the non-linearity of the human visual
system.
</p><p class="indent">   Digital cinema cameras usually adopt logarithmic encoding functions such as Sony
S-Log, ALEXA LogC or Canon C-Log allowing storage of a much wider dynamic range
from the original scene compared to a generic Rec. 709 HDTV camera. To some
degree, they are considered as flavors of the Cineon encoding found in the Kodak
Cineon System, an early 1990s computer-based digital film system. The main
difference between digital cinema cameras encodings and Cineon is that the latter
is a logarithmic encoding directly corresponding to the optical density of the
film negative. In order to know the relationship between a Cineon encoding
and scene light, it is necessary also to know the characteristic curve of the film
stock.

The Decoding CCTF, commonly an EOTF or inverse OETF, maps a non-linear
