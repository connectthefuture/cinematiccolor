          <p class="noindent">It is common in DI to create masters
          for multiple output devices. On major motion-pictures,
          masters for digital projection, film release, home
          theater in both HD and standard def, a mix of 2D and 3D,
          and most recently in wide gamut HDR are expected. The
          general approach is to identify one output as the gold
          standard and to spend the majority of the artistic time
          grading the images to look perfect on that device. For
          cinema, the theatrical digital projection is most often
          the appropriate master to treat as the reference. The
          director, producers, and other creatives will be present
          at this process. Once the main color grade is complete,
          additional masters are handled as trim passes atop the
          main output. Trim passes are most often implemented as
          additional color layers or nodes added after the master
          grade, and only utilize minor adjustments such as
          contrast, brightness, and saturation. The display
          transform baked into each master is device-specific; a
          different view transform tailored to each output device
          is a necessity. Where it is for conversion to a smaller
          colour space, and involves no change of dynamic range, it
          may be possible to perform the trim pass in an
          output-referred space. Creatives do not need to be
          present during the creation of trim passes, as the
          colorist is already familiar with the final look of the
          material and has a known reference to use as a color
          appearance target. To support deliverables for standard
          displays as well as next-generation displays, a workflow
          utilizing the EXR image format can be used. A creative
          look and tone mapping are followed by a display transform
          for viewing. For HDR deliverables, the standard look has
          a complimentary HDR look that can be swapped at any time
          for review or grading on an HDR display. This allows the
          production team to review their work on both conventional
          displays and in HDR to ensure the range of image values
          is technically accurate and creatively consistent in both
          formats. There are situations where some of the
          deliverables have a different artistic intent to the
          master, such as when a UHD HDR deliverable created after
          sign off on an SDR master. Because this deliverable
          significantly increases the range of colors beyond what
          was available during the initial digital cinema grade, a
          decision can be made to either create the HDR deliverable
          through a trim that stretches the original grade into the
          larger color volume of HDR or adjustments can be made in
          the grade itself to more fully utilize the additional
          information inherent in the source images. If a LUT has
          been used to apply the creative look for SDR, it may also
          be swapped out to an HDR look during this stage. The HDR
          format can reveal compromises in the source material that
          were not visible in the SDR master and require other
          corrections needed specifically for HDR. This needs to be
          considered to ensure enough time is allocated for HDR
          finishing.</p>
          <p class="indent">The motion-picture viewing environment
          greatly impacts color appearance. Theatrical viewing
          environments typically have dark surround and a
          relatively low screen luminance (14 fl, 48 cd/m2 is
          specified by DCI). In a desktop/office setting, an
          average surround is likely. Some common calibration
          targets demonstrate the variety of environment/ display
          combinations.</p>
          <p class="indent">Display Environment Screen luminance
          Gamma Theatrical digital projection dark surround 14 fl =
          48 cd/m2 2.6 Home digital projection dark surround 16 fl
          = 55 cd/m2 2.4 Reference TV monitor dim surround 29 fl =
          100 cd/m2 2.4 Home TV monitor average surround 50 fl =
          170 cd/m2 2.2 HDR10 monitor average surround 292 fl =
          1000 cd/m2 PQ</p>
          <p class="indent">Thus, the same image displayed in each
          environment will appear very different. Specifically, the
          perceived image contrast and colorfulness will vary.
          Color appearance models may be used to attempt to correct
          for these settings, but trim passes with a human in the
          loop typically yield far higher fidelity results.</p>
          <p class="indent">When mastering for stereoscopic 3D, an
          additional 3D specific trim pass is necessary. Due to the
          additional optics necessary to create the stereo image
          pair including additional filters in the projector and
          glasses on the audience, the projected stereo image is
          usually far lower luminance than traditional 2D
          theatrical projection. Early projection systems were
          limited to levels as low as 3.5 fl. As lower luminance
          images tend to appear less colorful, the trim passes for
          stereo masters typically boost both the saturation and
          contrast relative to the 2D master. However, this boost
          can impose a cost on image detail, for example clipping
          highlights. Also, the increased saturation and contrast
          will not be suitable for projection at significantly
          higher luminance. As projection technology has matured to
          support higher luminance projection this has led to the
          creation of multiple 3D deliverables. One way of managing
          this is to create a trim with boosted color for standard
          3D venues, and a full brightness 3D grade without any
          color boost for venues that are capable of projecting at
          or close to 14 fl.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.9.1</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-31-128" id="x31-1270003.9.1">Multiple
          deliverables</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">There are two different approaches to
          multiple format deliveries; one is that all deliverables
          should look the same or at least as close as possible.
          Clearly, making all decisions in the smallest color space
          (Rec. 709) makes it straightforward to deliver in all
          other formats. Alternatively, making decisions in the
          largest available color space will mean that other
          deliverables may lack some of the color or brightness of
          the master, but the overall quality is likely to be
          better. For example, the Dolby Vision workflow gives the
          DI colorist responsibility for all deliverables using
          scene by scene metadata, that effectively extends control
          over the image, all the way to the playback device.
          Similar decisions have to be made for resolution and
          aspect ratio.</p>
          <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a href="#x31-1280003.9.1"
          id="x31-1280003.9.1">Resolution</a></h5>
          <p class="noindent">The common resolutions for home
          deliverables are SD for DVD releases, HD for broadcast,
          Blu-ray and streaming, and UHD for newer channels
          including VOD and Blu-ray. Theatrical releases may have
          different aspect ratios but are also spread approximately
          between 2k and 4k resolutions. It is sensible for most
          production and post-production to target a 4k or better
          finishing pipeline. Editing can usually use lower
          resolution proxies, but full resolution files should be
          checked before making decisions. For wholly computer
          generated sources such as animated features there is a
          debate about whether 4k resolutions are needed.</p>
