          General Model of Color Processing</a></h3>
          <p class="noindent">Digital color management follows a
          clear general path tightly coupled with digital imaging.
          The high-level diagram below covers this path, from
          reflectance, image formation, storage and processing to
          display.</p>
          <p class="indent">The ’Computer Graphics’ box hides a
          complex pipeline that largely mimics the physical
          processes that precede it in this diagram, with the goals
          of creating content that will blend seamlessly with the
          captured image. Key: Purple - physical light, Blue -
          stored light, Green - Synthetic light, Orange - perceived
          light</p>
          <p class="indent">While there are many imaging
          considerations along the full imaging pipeline, such as
          spatial and temporal considerations, this discussion
          restricted itself to the propagation and transformation
          of color in the imaging pipeline.</p>
          <p class="indent">The simplest example of the digital
          color pipeline for cinema is exemplified by a digital
          camera, covering the full imaging pipeline from lens to
          sensor to the display on the back of the camera. Even
          this simplest case involves processing and transforms
          that are a microcosm of more complex pipelines. From this
          example, it is possible to expand to cover pipelines and
          workflows that have processing steps in-camera, on-set,
          in a scanning house, with editors, in a renderer, visual
          effects, animation and games teams, colorists,
          distribution processing, cinemas, streaming services and
          everywhere in between. In this section, the paper will
          present simple models for thinking about color processing
          and understanding which aspects are important in each
          phase of production.</p>
          <p class="indent">In the simple case mentioned above, an
          image captured by a digital camera and displayed on the
          screen on the back of the camera, there are a series of
          states and transforms to consider: Light reflected off a
          surface, into camera’s lens and onto an image sensor
          Sensor photosite values encoded and stored in memory A
          transform to combine adjacent Red, Green and Blue
          photosites into single pixel values A "working space"
          image in memory A transform to remap the intensities of
          the combined pixels for display A "displayable" image
          ready to be sent to the display hardware The display
          hardware showing the image</p>

          <p class="indent">The aspects of the example above that
          will show up repeatedly throughout this document are:</p>
          <p class="indent">Input, Working, Output: The example
          includes the stages that are common to most modern color
          pipelines, namely an Input, Capture or Generated image
          state, a Working image state used for editing and
          production and an Output image state used for display.
          There may be other steps along the way, but virtually all
          modern color pipeline designs contain these three
          distinct states. The Input image for a visual effects or
          animated feature or game may be the product of a
          renderer.</p>
          <p class="indent">Scene-referred, Output-referred images:
          The sensor image in Step 3 represents the intensity of
          light in the scene, filtered through the camera’s lens
          and specific red, green and blue filters over each sensor
          photosite. The "working space" image from Step 5 also
          represents the intensity of light in the scene, but may
          be device-independent, at least slightly abstracted from
          the camera sensor and processing hardware. After being
          transformed for display, the image in Step 6 has values
          representing the activations necessary for each of the
          target display’s pixels.</p>
          <p class="indent">Transforms - Input, Output, Look: Going
          between each image state is a transformation that has a
          specific, meaningful effect. The most widely used
          transforms will typically include a remapping of
          intensities and some degree of remapping of the color
          gamut: the underlying meaning of the red, green and blue
          of each pixel. There are many more exotic transforms, and
          often a number of these simpler transforms are
          concatenated. Transforms going from Input to the Working
          space are usually strictly defined based on the
          capabilities of the capture device and the attributes of
          the working space. Transforms from the Working space to
          the Output space usually combine an element of artistry,
          commonly referred to as "the Look", with an explicit
          mapping based on the capabilities of the output device.
          Later sections of the document contain many examples of
          transforms used in practice.</p>
          <p class="indent">Staged Processing: The process to go
          from light hitting the sensor to a display emitting light
          is defined by a specific, staged processing pipeline.
          Transforms take color from one image state to the next,
          constrained by the processing needs of each successive
          stage and the limitations and capabilities of the
          capture, processing and display hardware. Images may be
          written to disk or passed along an IO line representing
          the state of color at any of the points in the processing
          chain, as different applications or departments within
          production may be the source or the destination for the
          data.</p>
          <p class="indent">Meaning and Placement - Understanding
          how to work with an image or color data set is more
          natural when you can be clear about what the data is
          supposed to represent and where it lives in the
          production or product’s processing chain. These two
          elements, meaning and placement, provide the context
          needed to apply transformations and make aesthetic
          judgements in production.</p>

          <p class="noindent">The Academy Color Encoding System
          (ACES) is a color management system that embodied the
          general model of color processing described above. It
          codifies and standardizes many of the elements described
          in the Workflow section with an eye towards addressing
          many of the difficulties listed in the Challenges section
          below. The basic system diagram for ACES is presented
          below.</p>
          <p class="indent">ACES system diagram</p>
          <p class="indent">This diagram contains scene-referred
          imagery, transforms converting from one state or color
          space to the next, working spaces, output-referred
          imagery and an ordered, staged processing pipeline.</p>
          <p class="indent">ACES is one of many ways to define a
          color pipeline, but it presents a nice embodiment of the
          general model of color processing presented above,
          mirrored in most of the examples discussed in this paper.
          ACES will be referenced throughout this document because
          it is open, well documented, widely available and has
          been used successfully in a wide variety of projects of
          all types and complexities. It provides a great starting
          point for exploration. This should not be taken as a
          suggestion that ACES is the only or necessarily the best
          option. Decisions about which color transforms and spaces
          to use should be base on the requirements and constraints
          of a given project.</p>
