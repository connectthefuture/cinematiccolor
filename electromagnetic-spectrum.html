          <p class="noindent">Color is a perceived sensation that
          occurs when light interacts with the HVS. The CIE defines
          light as the "electromagnetic radiation that is
          considered from the point of view of its ability to
          excite the human visual system."</p>
          <p class="indent">The electromagnetic spectrum from
          approximately 360-780 nm is visible to human observers
          and called the visible spectrum. Note that color
          sensations produced above are limited to those the
          particular display used to view this document can
          represent.</p>
          <p class="indent">In Opticks, Isaac Newton (1704)
          investigates the fundamental nature of light and color by
          describing the refraction of light by prisms. Newton
          demonstrated that a prism can separate seemingly
          achromatic light into components perceived as distinct
          hues, with each hue refracted at a unique and consistent
          angle; that this separated light may be recombined,
          either entirely to recover the achromatic color, or
          selectively, by which he could produce any desired color
          sensation.</p>
          <p class="indent">Comparison of an original scene on the
          left and a version where its light is dispersed
          horizontally with a Star Analyser 100 (SA-100)
          diffraction grating demonstrating that the seemingly
          white light from the Sun illuminating the scene is
          composed of distinct hues.</p>
          <p class="indent">Newton asserted that color is a visual
          sensation and not an inherent property of the light or
          object materials. He supported this assertion by noting
          that a magenta (purple) sensation can be created by
          combining red and violet components of two spectra, but
          this sensation is not produced by any single component of
          refracted light.</p>
          <p class="indent">The measurement of the radiation across
          the entire electromagnetic spectrum is known as
          radiometry. In this document, the focus is almost
          entirely on radiation within the visible spectrum.
          Photometry is a subset of radiometry concerned solely
          with radiation within the visible spectrum, where the
          measurement of energy at a particular wavelength in that
          spectrum is weighted by the sensitivity of the HVS at
          that wavelength. A comprehensive description of
          radiometry and photometry is beyond the scope of this
          document, but the next sections define some necessary
          radiometric and photometric quantities used in digital
          imaging and color science. Their descriptions below are
          taken from Wyszecki and Stiles (2000).</p>

          (or luminous flux) (Pv) is the quantity derived from
          radiant power by evaluating the radiant energy according

          luminous intensity in the given direction of an
          infinitesimal element of the surface containing the point

          A convenient non-SI (International System of Units)
          shorthand for the luminance unit is nit from the latin
          nitere, to shine. Relative Luminance (Y) is luminance
          normalized to the range 0-1 or 0-100, relative to a
          reference white Luminance value. Key Points Color is
          perceived when light interacts with the HVS. Light is the
          visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
          Achromatic light can be separated into distinct hues by
          prisms. Those distinct hues can be recombined by prisms
          to recover the achromatic light. Color is not an inherent
          property of the light or object materials: magenta does
          not exist as a distinct hue but is perceived when
          combined red and blue hues. Radiometry is the measurement
          of radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
          Photometry is the measurement of radiation weighted by
          the sensitivity of the HVS across the visible
          spectrum.</p>

          illumination towards the middle of this range, at 555 nm
          (yellow-green). At the extremes, radiant energy below

          absorptance spectra of a Sorghum Halepense leaf from
          LOPEX93. Chlorophyll absorbs a large quantity of blue and
          red radiation giving leaves their green color. Light,
          through its fluctuations and spectral quality, has
          contributed to shaping the adaptation of many species.
          Chlorophyll, contained in plants chloroplasts, is a
          pigment which absorbs light during photosynthesis. It
          absorbs violet, blue and red wavelengths while reflecting
          green wavelengths.</p>
          <p class="indent">Sparks, DasSarma, and Reid (2006) and
          DasSarma and Schwieterman (2018) have proposed the
          hypothesis that early photosynthetic organisms may have
          used retinal pigment which has a peak absorption centered
          at 550nm, thus absorbing most of the green wavelengths.
          The chlorophyll based organisms that appeared later
          adapted by absorbing the remaining regions of the
          electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
          <p class="indent">Solar spectral irradiance compared to
          CIE 1924 Photopic Standard Observer, note how both peak
          around 555nm.</p>
          <p class="indent">The solar spectral irradiance is
          thought to be a fundamental driver of the evolution of
          the HVS and peaks in the central region of the visible
          spectrum. Boynton (1990) says that "this coincidence is
          probably not accidental, but is more likely the product
          of biological evolution." Wang, Tang, and Yan (2011) have
          shown that the spectral sensitivities of photoreceptors
          of different species of moray eel were correlated with
          the photic characteristics of their habitats.</p>
          <p class="indent">Key Points A spectral distribution
          characterizes, at each wavelength, the radiant power
          emitted by a light source or the percentage of light
          reflected, transmitted or absorbed by a surface. The
          wavelengths range of the visible spectrum is
          approximately 360-780nm. Spectral sensitivity of the HVS
          peaks at 555nm, ultraviolet radiation below 360nm or
          infrared radiation above 780nm is invisible. The solar
          spectral irradiance peaks in the central region of the
          visible spectrum and is thought to be an essential driver
          of the evolution of the HVS.</p>
