          Grading</a></h3>
          <p class="noindent">Locking down the eventual DI viewing
          transform(s) early on is the critical first step in
          crafting cinematic color pipelines, as it pins down every
          other part of the process. The remainder of the pipeline
          essentially relies on visualizations that are created by
          working backwards from this step. Renders by Sony

          intermediate (DI) grading is the process where the entire
          motion-picture is loaded into a digital device, for the
          purpose of color-grading in an environment that exactly
          mirrors the final exhibition. Although the colorist may
          get involved much earlier in the project, DI grading is
          usually the final stage of post-production, where
          per-shot color grading is added and the visual look of
          the film is finalized and baked in. Color timing is the
          term used for traditional film lab color adjustments. The
          term Color correction is generally avoided as it implies
          that the original cinematography or VFX was flawed.
          However, correction is still used by colorists to mean
          continuity adjustments. The final step of baking in the
          Look, view transforms specific to different output
          devices plus any trims applied as a result of those
          transforms, is known as Mastering. As with so many terms
          encountered in this document the language is used
          imprecisely and often one term is substituted for another
          without the understanding of the finer implications.
          Whilst DI is generally understood to mean the color grade
          and mastering stage, it technically includes the entire
          post-production process and dates back to the 1990s when
          Kodak, who coined the phrase, were creating digital
          intermediate scenes for VFX then recording them back to
          film and cutting them into the intermediate negative, aka
          the interneg. Hence the term digital intermediate.</p>
          <p class="indent">The DI grade often follows a conform of
          the edit decisions, which are usually made from proxies,
          using original source material and scene referred final
          effects. The conform includes final sound and titles,
          though these may not be available at the beginning of the
          session. When time is more important than quality or when
          the edit decision list cannot be exported, the DI grade
          can be applied to an export from the edit system. This is
          a major compromise and not recommended.</p>
          <p class="indent">In games, the tasks and roles of the
          development team are not so delineated. There is rarely a
          specialist colorist involved and hence no DI grading
          session. However, games use the same or similar tools as
          DI grading integrated into the creation process. The
          nature of most games engines mandates a scene-referred
          workflow with a choice of output transforms to support
          play on any device. Consequently, Look Management is
          often part of the engine and far less of an issue than in
          the other disciplines. However there is still the concept
          of a mastering process, involving final quality
          adjustments in a review suite on one or more reference
          displays.</p>
          <p class="indent">There are two main approaches to
          handling color in the DI grade. Unmanaged Output Referred
          Color Managed Scene Referred</p>
          <p class="indent">The reference display must always be
          accurately calibrated and checked regularly. Color grade
          decisions should be made in real time to avoid chromatic
          adaptation induced errors.</p>
          <p class="indent">The first approach, unmanaged, is
          output-referred and began in the days of telecine and
          hardware grading systems. A telecine is a device that
          transfers film to video in real time. Telecines predate
          video tape recorders when the only way of recording or
          playing back recorded images was to use film. In the
          early days, recorded programs were broadcast from live
          telecine transmissions, but as the equipment and the
          standards improved, programming interfaces were added so
          that scene by scene grading could be applied. Programmed
          grades were mostly recorded to video tape recorders
          (VTRs) so the output was always a real-time video stream.
          There was no need for color management since there was
          only ever a single playout format and the grading
          accuracy was wholly dependent on the monitor calibration.
          The calibrated telecine monitor was often referred to as
          the "god monitor" so its importance was always very
          clear. In the modern version of unmanaged grading,
          imagery is loaded into a non-linear timeline with
          real-time playback capability; no viewing transform is
          applied. The image is manipulated in the grading system,
          akin to a motion-picture version of Photoshop, to look
          correct on the calibrated reference display. The grading
          system and the colorist using it, treat all media, video
          or log, in the same way, and decisions are all
          output-referred. Different camera image processing,
          exposure, transfer functions and VFX elements are
          generally matched and graded by eye rather than
          analytically. For those used to a Color Managed workflow,
          it might seem strange that anyone would work this way,
          but for decades this was the only possible approach and
          the resistance to change in our industry cannot be
          underestimated. The output-referred method is strongly
          discouraged. However, it it is sometimes used if there is
          insufficient data about the color gamut and the transfer
          function of the material on the timeline. Using incorrect
          color science can cause distortion, artifacts and
          clipping. See 3.3.1 Camera profiles for more detail.
          Output-referred grading is also used in television and
          commercials where DI grading is not always the last
          process and there is typically a single delivery format.
          Scene-referred grading is considered slower, more
          demanding and generally more expensive in some markets
          and because they have less time, smaller budgets and
          shorter-term products they are slow to transition. When
          there is no color management in the final DI grading
          session, it is much more difficult to implement accurate
          Look Management. Nevertheless, preview LUTs from the
          colorist can be used on set and in editing or grades from
          the DIT or editor can be used as a reference for the DI
          colorist.</p>
          <p class="indent">The second Color Managed approach is
          usually, but not always scene-referred. For the DI grade,
          the reference display is pivotal to the color managed
          transforms. The display format is defined by the delivery
          specification and when there are multiple deliverables
          the largest gamut for which there is a calibrated display
          is chosen. The timeline color space should be
          scene-referred and all sources mapped to it.</p>
          <p class="indent">Sometimes the output color space is
          used as the working color space and transforms are only
          applied to the sources. With this approach grading is
          output-referred, and there is no real benefit to it, so
          it is not discussed further in this paper.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.7.1</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-29-114" id=
          "x29-1130003.7.1">Conforming</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">The dated video-centric approach to
          grading comes from the time when colorists worked on a
          reel of film or a tape. Film and tape sources playback as
          a fixed linear timeline and were usually graded out of
          context. Media was passed from color grading back to
          editorial for mastering. That workflow is still used
          especially for commercial work, although the tape source
          has now been replaced by a random access digital file.
          The file is broken down into shots or events either by
          loading an edit decision list (EDL) or by scene detecting
          the program. The workflow is not ideal for VFX inserts
          but in this scenario completed VFX files are added by the
          editor, prior to the color grade. Titles are added after
          the color grade. VFX are usually submitted as
          output-referred files that match the delivery format
          reference display. This allows very little manipulation
          in grading and can suffer a quality loss since the
          pipeline is not scientifically color managed. A more
          flexible alternative is to discuss the process with the
          editor and deliver VFX log encoded, preserving more
          dynamic range and having more latitude in the grade.
          Since the final look is unknown until after the DI grade,
          the VFX log image, just like camera media benefits from
          this extended dynamic range.</p>
          <p class="indent">In the recommended workflow, the DI
          colorist receives the edit decision list, the original
          source material, VFX that match the source material and
          the final soundtracks, and then conforms them as a
          multi-track non-linear timeline in the grading system.
          The conform might be done by the colorist, an assistant
          or by an editor dedicated to the task. The colorist then
          matches the scenes, manages the look and applies shot to
          shot or frame to frame fixes as necessary. The best
          results are obtained from a scene-referred workflow that
          uses color managed transforms at each stage. This brings
          different sources closer together before the grading
          begins, but more importantly, it makes it much easier to
          deliver alternate formats using output transforms, which
          are more accurate and less work than using just trims. It
          also permits VFX, editorial and other departments to see
          representative images on displays calibrated to different
          standards, at any stage of the process.</p>
          <p class="indent">The edit decision list could be as
          simple as one or more EDL files, one per track, but is
          usually an XML or AAF that supports multiple tracks. A
          reference movie of the cut should be provided to check
          for errors in conform. These are particularly likely to
          occur when size and speed changes are included in the
          edit decision list. This list is crucial in selecting
          shots for VFX and determining the exact frames required.
          VFX should be returned with frame handles of a consistent
          length which simplifies conforming if there are updates.
          The number of frames in the handles should be agreed and
          specified early in the production. Mattes generated at
          the time the VFX are rendered are best combined as an
          alpha channel or multi layer EXR. Mattes created later in
          post production for use in DI grading can be delivered as
          separate files. Most DI grading systems can parse
          separate mattes from the RGB and alpha channels of an
          image file. The mattes need to be synchronized with the
          effect shot so it is always recommended that the matte
          and the image files have identical timecode or frame
          count. Usually, the effect shot and the matte are trimmed
          to the required frames, with handles if specified, and
          have the same duration. The file names should be
          identical except for a suffix for the mattes. Mattes and
          images are, however, usually placed in separate folders
          to simplify the conform process. Clearly, if two files
          with similar filenames and identical timecode exist in
          the same folder there is a good chance that the matte and
          the image will get confused during an auto conform.</p>
          <p class="indent">In the modern DI workflow, the first
          conform happens before picture lock, which allows the
          colorist to export precise frame sequences for VFX. The
          colorist’s first pass focuses on neutralization, matching
          the adjacent shots in the cut at the time. The colorist
          may have already started work on the Look and more
          detailed select parts of the frame, but these should not
          be present in the export. The ideal export format is EXR,
          as it can preserve all the available source data. In
          current practice, VFX facilities prefer to have exported
          frames in the original camera format along with CDLs that
          encode the first pass neutralization. This reduces the
          likelihood of issues that crop up when images have been
          processed by different packages that may have differing
          implementations of transforms that should match. Input
          Transforms are currently a prominent source of variation
          between software packages. When returning finished VFX
          for integration into the DI conform master it is
          important to have a clear policy on handles, color gamut,
          white point, file naming and format. VFX may come from a
          variety of facilities around the world, so if each team
          use a different process they are unlikely to integrate
          well. Generally, VFX shots returned to the DI conform
          should retain the naming convention and timecode of the
          supplied plates with a suffix appended for versions and
          dates. Technically EXR is again the preferred format, but
          productions may choose DPX or a Quicktime or MXF wrapper
          for practical reasons.</p>

          Output Referred Grading</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">The advantage of the output-referred
          "video" approach is one of process simplicity. However,
          when grading pre-rendered gamma-encoded imagery, a
          relatively modest amount of color adjustment can be
          applied without introducing artifacts. The downside to
          this approach is that much of the detail in the original
          imagery is lost when baking-in the view transform, which
          typically happens before or at the beginning of the
          grade. Indeed, in some implementations, this baking-in of
          the view transform may even be internal to the camera, or
          in animated features, inside the renderer. For example,
          if a shot was originally overexposed, a sensible color
          correction is to darken the image. However, it is likely
          that in an overexposed image large portions of the image
          will be clipped by the view transform to a constant
          maximum value, and no possible correction can bring back
          this lost detail. Additionally, this video style approach
          is particularly unsuited to producing HDR versions. It is
          inherently tied to the dynamic range of the display used
          in the DI, so the HDR and SDR versions must be done as
          completely separate grades.</p>

          <p class="noindent">An original log film plate (top-left)
          is loaded into the color grading system. When viewed with
          a film emulation table (top-right), the appearance is
          predictive of the final output with a default exposure.
          If the exposure is lowered using an additive offset in
          log-space (lower-left), new details in the flame
          highlights are revealed. When a similar adjustment is
          applied in an output-referred space (lower-right), this
          detail is lost. Imagery from "Spider-Man" Courtesy of
          Columbia Pictures. ? 2002 Columbia Pictures Industries,
          Inc. All rights reserved. Going back to the overexposed
          example, all of the dynamic range from the original
          camera capture is preserved when using a scene-referred
          approach. Thus, when the exposure on log data changes,
          new details which had not previously been visible through
          the view transform may be revealed as no clipping has
          occurred. This allows color grading in log DI to be very
          high fidelity and most trims do not result in a flat
          black or flat white in the image.</p>
          <p class="indent">In the color managed approach,
          scene-referred imagery is loaded into the machine along
          with a viewing transform specific to the target reference
          display to create the final Look. The color grade
          manipulates the underlying scene-referred representation,
          but all color judgments are made previewing through the
          output transform. It is increasingly common to create an
          approved master for the main delivery format and then to
          use a trim pass in conjunction with each different output
          transform required. The trim pass can be an additional
          grade or metadata.</p>
          <p class="indent">Camera raw images are the preferred
          choice of the colorist for the master grade. Failing that
          a camera-specific integer log encoding is utilized.
          Camera raw images are typically recognized by the main DI
          grading systems and facilitate the use of the correct
          camera transforms.</p>
          <p class="indent">DPX was commonly used as a log delivery
          format to DI and both 10 bit and 16 bit integer versions
          were common-place. For grainy material 10 bit is often
          sufficient. DPX is still used for film scans and integer
          sources such as a camera debayering. When passing true
          scene-referred linear renders directly to the DI grade,
          16 bit floating-point EXR is preferable. 16 bit integer
          linear representations are not recommended.</p>
          <p class="indent">All DI grading systems process
          floating-point internally and can happily read EXR files,
          which have replaced 10 bit DPX as the preferred
          interchange format. However, the size of EXR and 16 bit
          DPX is currently costly for storage, processing, and
          bandwidth, so their use is far from ubiquitous, and some
          productions still use 10 bit DPX, even though it is less
          than ideal.</p>
          <p class="indent">For viewing, a suitable output
          transform for the target reference display is applied.
          The DI grading transform should match the Look Management
          transform. The color managed workflow should be agreed on
          and shared with everyone on the project, including those
          on set and during production to maintain consistency of
          the images and avoid the need to bake in the transform
          until the delivery stage. The scene-referred working
          format is an excellent archival master. The graded scene
          master can generate multiple deliverables and is the main
          asset but un ungraded version is often kept too. More
          information is available in the ACES Digital Source
          Master specification. Resolution and bit depth of all
          work should ideally be at least the same as that of the
          camera original media.</p>
          <p class="indent">For a simple, robust color managed
          workflow, ACES as described in 3.1 Academy Color Encoding
          System (ACES) is ideal. ACES is supported in a wide range
          of software applications and the standard input and
          output transforms are reliably consistent. ACES uses EXR
          files to store scene-referred data that encompasses all
          of the visible spectrum.</p>
          <p class="indent">When film was the primary theatrical
          deliverable, the viewing LUT used to be matched to a
          specific film lab and print stock, but that is rarely
          true now. Today theatres and broadcasters expect digital
          masters and the reference monitor should use the largest
          color encoding of all the deliverables. For the
          theatrical exhibition that is usually DCI P3 but for most
          broadcast deliveries it is still Rec. 709. VOD platforms
          and games devices are targeting HDR displays, which are
          currently limited to P3 color gamut with D65 white point,
          delivered as Rec. 2020. There are several flavors of HDR
          but they all use either PQ (Perceptual Quantiser) or
          Hybrid Log Gamma transfer functions. It is quite simple
          to convert between the two, but since PQ is by far the
          most common in practice, mastering to a PQ reference
          monitor, P3 gamut and D65 white point are recommended.
          All deliverables can come from that. Whatever the output
          transform is, it is highly recommended that the master is
          created by color grading the image in a scene-referred
          color space and making visual decisions based on the
          appearance after the output transform.</p>
          <p class="indent">Standard practice is to start with the
          DCI theatrical master even though it will not always
          serve as a universal master for other deliverables.
          Artistic intent and the bulk of the creative decisions
          are inherent in the theatrical master so the DI grading
          project with a broader output transform can be re-used as
          a very efficient starting point for the universal master.
          Dolby Vision cinema, Eclaircolor and Samsung Onyx masters
          can only be color graded in a theatre on a screen of the
          same type as the target cinema. These deliverables are
          only ever created in their final viewing environment.</p>
          <p class="indent">Artistically, the DI process can be
          segmented into a per-shot correction that neutralizes
          shot to shot color variation, and then a secondary grade
          that crafts the overall artistic look of the film. With
          those two adjustments as a base, further work is carried
          out to manipulate audience experience of the scene and to
          address any distractions or inconsistencies. As a rule
          colorists work on sequences, though sometimes with
          dynamic changes in a shot. Any work that needs to be done
          frame by frame is usually best done as VFX rather than DI
          grading. It is common for the DI facility, if an initial
          grade happens early enough, to communicate to the VFX
          houses the Looks being used. This often is sent as a CDL,
          or a 3D LUT, per shot and does not have the viewing
          transform baked into it. It is also important to
          communicate the color space that the color grades have
          been applied in as the CDL or 3D LUT will not produce the
          intended result without this information. Most often, the
          DI grading reference display is calibrated to a color
          space that is the same as the delivery format. Key Points
          A color managed scene referred grade is recommended

          Grading</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">The final DI grade takes place after
          the conform, but often before picture lock. If possible
          the colorist starts the grade before VFX are ready and
          expects to add them to the conformed timeline along with
          further editorial changes. The grade has three main
          objectives. First, it must match consecutive scenes
          seamlessly, even though they may come from different
          sources or different color gamuts. Second, it is the
          final stage before delivery and the whole project, not
          just the images must look the best it can. Whilst the
          phase is known as DI grading, the DI colorist acts as a
          crucial QC of the finished master. The DI grade may be
          the only environment to have large, calibrated displays
          and might also be the first time that final audio, VFX,
          titles and composites are seen under critical monitoring
          conditions. In the ideal world, problems would be sent
          back to the appropriate team, but as red carpet day looms
          it is often the colorist who has to fix any remaining
          problems, even if those problems are sound sync,
          reflections of the crew in shot or errors in the credits.
          Thirdly, most important of all, the grade must enhance
          the concept by communicating emotion, environment and
          clarity. Like VFX, the best grades are often the least
          noticeable yet still manage to add depth to the narrative
          or content. Early on in the DI process, the colorist,
          editor and VFX departments collaborate and interact. A
          post-production supervisor might manage the interaction,
          but as deadlines loom, remaining changes are increasingly
          left for the colorist. It saves time and helps to keep
          things running smoothly if files are exchanged in an
          orderly way.</p>
          <p class="indent">The project Look is designed to some
          degree in pre-production. In animation, the look is
          usually established quite early on. In games, the look
          evolves as the game develops. In DI grading the Look can
          be established and communicated through a common
          transform or show LUT or it might be left until the final
          DI grade itself. If the colorist is given access to the
          scene-referred source files and information on their
          color gamut, a well-managed color pipeline can and should
          be used through the final mastering stages. Raw camera
          captures usually contain sufficient metadata to identify
          their encoding and color space. However, if the files
          have already been encoded to a more manageable wrapper,
          ProRes, for example, problems can arise. Colorists often
          receive files that are either not scene-referred, or the
          information about their true origin has been lost along
          the way. When this happens, the colorist can only use
          experience and good judgment to grade the project and the
          opportunity to finish through a properly color managed
          workflow is often lost. If it is absolutely necessary to
          simplify the DI grade by working from a conformed source
          in a compressed wrapper format instead of the original
          source files it is crucial to preserve information about
          the source and history of each shot and useful to ensure
          that all scenes are correctly transformed into the same
          scene referred working color space. Failure to do so can
          result in problems and a loss of quality that should have
          been easily avoided.</p>
          <p class="indent">When EXR source images or camera raw
          files are delivered for DI grading the established Look
          for standard dynamic range is used to begin the initial
          grade for digital cinema. The source images may be
          supplemented with additional matte images created by VFX
          that allow individual characters, or even specific
          elements like hair or eyes, to be isolated for color
          grading. Following the completion and approval of the
          digital cinema grade, a trim pass is performed for
          theatrical 3D exhibition. Typically this will involve an
          increase in contrast and saturation to compensate for the
          lower projection brightness in this environment. Next, a
          trim pass is performed for theatrical HDR. The standard
          range look is swapped out for a matching look with
          extended highlight range. Because theatrical HDR is
          capable of much darker blacks than standard digital
          cinema projection, black levels may be further adjusted
          during the trim pass to maintain appropriate levels of
          contrast. Rec. 709 for home deliverables is also derived
          from the digital cinema grade as a trim pass. In this
          case, a gamma adjustment is made for the change in the
          viewing environment. Also, the Rec. 709 color gamut is
          smaller than the digital cinema P3 gamut so some amount
          of gamut compression may be necessary to preserve image
          details that would otherwise clip. Lastly, a home HDR
          grade is performed using the digital grade as a starting
          point, but substituting an HDR look that targets the much
          brighter highlight range, color and shadow detail
          achievable on HDR televisions. The home HDR grade is
          followed by an analysis to generate HDR metadata. For
          deliverables that require dynamic metadata, such as Dolby
          Vision, the HDR master is reviewed by the colorist on
          different displays and further metadata adjustments
          recorded.</p>
          <p class="indent">There is a range of grading systems in
          use today, and very few of their tools are
          interchangeable with each other, let alone VFX software.
          This makes it a challenge for VFX teams to apply
          reversible transforms or to view accurate simulations of
          the DI grade without baking it in. The most common
          methods of previewing VFX are LUTs and CDL. Most color
          grading systems can export grades as a LUT, however, the
          limitations of LUTs apply. The two main limitations are
          that they apply changes to the whole image, with no
          ability to apply specific changes to selected areas of
          the image, and that they often clip or produce
          interpolation errors. See the Appendix 4.4 LUTs and
          Transforms for a more in-depth discussion.</p>
          <p class="indent">Whenever possible, it is best to
          preview shots in a grading suite or theatrical
          environment as a confidence check. When there are
          multiple facilities contributing to different aspects of
          the show it eventually comes down to getting together in
          a color suite with a calibrated and controlled
          environment to ensure that all of the moving pieces do in
          fact work together. For example, if two VFX plates are
          cut together and one is slightly warmer, removing red
          would make a purple suit not match the following shot, so
          the purple needs to be adjusted separately. Adjusting
          individual elements through the use of mattes, keys and
          shapes is called secondary correction. This goes for the
          sky, skin tones, background and more, even without an
          overall change in direction of the Look. Often the Look
          continues to evolve after production and VFX right up to
          the finishing of the project, which happens in the
          grading suite.</p>

          <p class="noindent">Color grading tools have evolved with
          technology. In the early days of film, adjustments were
          limited to exposure and color tinting. With color film
          came color timing with RGB printer lights, which are
          quite literally filtered lights to alter the color of the
          print copy. In the video era, analog and then digital
          tools were developed to optimize film transfers to video
          via a telecine. The DI grading software of today
          typically copies or emulates the historical processes,
          and adds new features from computer graphics, VFX,
          digital cameras and improved color science. New software
          grading tools appear slowly, often a long time after the
          technology that requires them. At the time of writing,
          there are few special tools for HDR display grades for
          example. Colorists consequently have become adept at
          repurposing tools to fit new needs. Grading software has
          become sophisticated enough that it is rarely possible to
          recognize the exact tool or software from the result.
          However, there are significant differences in alternative
          approaches to the grade. These differences must be
          considered part of the creative process but a review of
          the most common techniques can help to understand how a
          look is crafted and how look management is integral to
          the process. In short the tools used and the order in
          which they are used, affect the outcome.</p>
          <p class="indent">The following section discusses tools
          and workflows in more detail as the workflow, or more
          specifically the working color space the tools are used
          with changes the effect of each tool. Some systems have
          tools that attempt to achieve the same behavior in each
          different color space, although that mandates a full
          color managed approach. Other systems have less
          sophisticated solutions in which the range of a tool is
          altered according to the color space and many systems
          have controls that can be tweaked by the user as needed.
          However, the most basic commonly used tools are
          surprisingly agnostic about where they are used, and
          consequently, they feel and react differently in
          different workflows. The controls are written with a
          capital, e.g. Offset, to distinguish them from pure
          mathematical operators e.g. offset.</p>
          <p class="indent">For simplicity, an unmanaged color
          workflow reveals the raw nature of two different grading
          tools. An unmanaged workflow is a workflow in which the
          source color space, the timeline color space, and the
          output color space are all the same and so no transforms
          are applied by the system. This is still the default for
          many DI grading systems and many colorists continue to
          work this way since it is easier, usually requiring no
          project set up at all. This section, therefore, describes
          color grading tools as used in the older WYSIWYG approach
          and is output-referred. This is not the recommended
          approach but serves to best illustrate the nature of the
          toolsets and how they are used.</p>
          <p class="indent">ARRI LogC source image with references.

          <p class="indent">For the purposes of discussion, the
          above test image is processed in different ways. The
          source image has a deliberately wide dynamic range
          captured with an ARRI camera as ALEXA LogC. The color
          chart and the two faces at the top of the image are from
          the camera. Bottom left is a waveform representation of
          the processing applied to the image and below that a
          grayscale ramp from which the waveform is derived. The
          waveform does not reflect the image itself, only the
          processing applied. Bottom right is a vectorscope display
          of the color chart which was part of the camera capture.
          The vectorscope only shows the chromaticity of the chart
          after processing and is a useful way to compare
          saturation and hue shifts. The image above is unprocessed
          so the waveform and ramp show a true linear response. The
          following examples are not color graded in the true sense
          of the term, they are examples of the starting point for
          a DI grade. This type of adjustment to get a reasonable
          starting point is sometimes called the Technical Grade or
          a dailies grade. On a real job some color balancing is
          often needed too, but for this test, neither color
          balance nor saturation was adjusted. To obtain a
          realistic comparison the test image was graded using a
          limited toolset with a waveform as a reference. The grade
          sets a technical black level and enough contrast to use
          as much of the available dynamic range as possible,
          whilst retaining a pleasing result on both pale and dark
          skin in the same image on a calibrated Rec. 709
          display.</p>
          <p class="indent">These examples are not exhaustive,
          there are countless variations possible. The purpose of
          this exercise is to underline the absolute need for good
          Look Management. The above image is scene-referred, so
          the real world examples shown here are intended to
          demonstrate that using no color management or different
          color management causes the Look to change significantly.
          At best, this results in more work to maintain
          continuity. At worst the intended Look must be
          compromised or completely re-thought in order to deliver
          high-quality images. Goo d Look Management is all about
          consistency.</p>
          <p class="indent">The three trackballs that make a
          grading control surface so recognizable are initially
          mapped to Lift Gamma and Gain (LGG) in most systems.
          Since these are the first available controls it is not
          surprising that they are the most commonly used by many
          colorists. The actual math behind the LGG set can differ
          between manufacturers, and a few systems offer several
          versions, but these tools originate from the telecine era
          of transferring film to video. Since film stocks have
          different response to light in the shadows,
          midtonesmid-tones and highlights, colorists needed
          separate controls for them to manage the film dynamic
          range in the much more limited video gamut.</p>
          <p class="indent">The Lift or Black control pivots around
          white and affects all code values except white. The
          definition of white is typically code value 1023 in a 10
          bit range but again can vary among tools and systems. The
          tool is ideal for balancing blacks in any color space
          because the darkest tones are always affected more than
          the lighter tones, but it is not very selective. A
          characteristic of this tool is that it pushes the darkest
          parts of the image, the blacks, harder than any other
          tone, so when lowering the black point it is prone to
          causing compressed or clipped shadow detail. In look
          creation, sometimes this is desirable and sometimes
          not.</p>
          <p class="indent">Gain is similar in use to Lift but
          pivots around the black point or 0. Again different tools
          and systems can define the black value differently, but
          if the black point is anything above 0, further
          conditions need to be defined so that values below black
          are not affected. When increasing Gain to brighten an
          image, the brightest values are the first to be clipped
          or compressed.</p>
          <p class="indent">The Gamma control varies between
          systems far more than lift and gain but is always a
          simple curve that distributes values towards shadows or
          highlights. It should normally not affect the absolute
          black or white level. In many systems, the Gamma control
          has a fixed range that is output-referred. Consequently,
          when used on a log source in a scene-referred workflow
          the code values that become black and white levels at the
          display are well within the range of the Gamma control
          and do affect blacks and whites. For this reason, many
          colorists avoid a simple Gamma control altogether.</p>
          <p class="indent">ARRI LogC image graded with Lift,
          Gamma, Gain, and no color management. Image ? Geoff Boyle
          All rights reserved.</p>
          <p class="indent">In the test image Lift was used to
          lower the deepest shadows to black on the waveform and
          Gain was used to bring the brightest details in the
          flowers to white on the waveform. A small Gamma control
          adjustment was then applied for a pleasing start point.
          Without color management, the saturation remains low and
          there is better hue separation in the warm colors than
          the cool ones. The result is a quite contrasty, hard
          looking, low saturated image. The waveform and ramp show
          clipping, but since none of the values in the test image
          are in the clipped range that is not a problem. However,
          it is worth noting that the definition of the white clip
          point is arbitrarily chosen by eye in this example.
          Setting the whites to clip in this way is the beginning
          of crafting a look.</p>
          <p class="indent">When DI grading was first introduced
          around 2000, there was some controversy over the use of
          these video tools in a film to film process. In film
          timing, there were less sophisticated tools and many felt
          that in order to retain the essence of the negative to
          print chemical process, those tools should be more
          closely emulated. Interestingly, the resulting DI tools,
          Offset and Contrast, did not exist in any of the video
          hardware color grading systems, though there were
          comparable tools in the telecines themselves.</p>
          <p class="indent">Offset is an additive function applied
          to all the image code values, so on its own, it does not
          differentiate any tonal range from another. It is
          confusingly labeled Offset, Black, Lift (incorrectly),
          Exposure, Density and probably some other terms according
          to the system in use.</p>
          <p class="indent">In scene-referred linear, a gain
          operation is typically used to change the color balance
          and scene exposure. In log space, this roughly
          corresponds to additive offsets. If a mathematically
          exact log is used, they are in fact identical, though
          most manufacturers tweak the log encodings as previously
          mentioned. Log offset color adjustments per color channel
          are ubiquitous in motion-picture industry color grading
          and often referred to as the "primary grade". Theatrical
          "fades to black" have a very particular appearance to
          them, which is a direct consequence of the fade being
          applied in log space, as viewed through the traditional
          "S-shaped" film emulation. Fade to blacks applied as gain
          operations in scene-referred linear have a roughly
          similar visual appearance, with specular highlights
          lingering on screen well beyond mid-tones.</p>
          <p class="indent">The Contrast tool in a workflow that is
          not color managed is usually an s-curve with an
          adjustable pivot, applied after Offset. The contrast tool
          pushes low mid-tones towards black and high mid-tones
          towards white and approximately simulates the response of
          a film print stock. It has a less aggressive look than
          lift and gain and is similar to a color management tone
          map curve. In color managed systems the output transform
          is likely to include an s-curve and the Contrast tool
          might then be a straight line pivoting around an
          adjustable mid-point so that the two do not conflict. The
          overall visual result is still an s-curve.</p>
          <p class="indent">ARRI LogC image graded with Offset /
          Contrast and no color management. Image ? Geoff Boyle All
          rights reserved.</p>
          <p class="indent">In the test image, Contrast (S-Curve)
          was used to adjust the dynamic range to the display and
          Offset to bring the range out of clipping. The contrast
          pivot point was adjusted to maximize the difference
          between shadows and highlights. Once again this was a
          purely technical approach based on the image content.
          Interestingly, this approach produces an even harder look
          and struggles to get a good representation of the darker
          skin. A lower contrast setting would work better for both
          faces but would have left the image looking milky with
          either lifted blacks or whites below peak. The waveform
          and ramp show that there is no clipping, which would make
          it better for a viewing LUT. Chromaticity is only
          slightly changed from the LGG example. When Offset is
          used with Contrast, the Contrast control shapes the
          results.</p>
          <p class="indent">There is a third type of control found
          in many systems, that consists of three tools often
          described as shadows, mid-tones and highlights. These
          tools are more selective and curve away from a pivot
          point. The pivot points may be user-defined and the
          shadow, mid-tone and highlight ranges may or may not
          overlap, The result is something in between LGG and
          Offset/Contrast. A single grading system may have just
          these basic two tool sets or many more variations to
          choose from. In some systems, the tools are modified
          slightly by the project settings for color space, and in
          others, they can be redefined each time they are used.
          Where there are many variations of the primary tools, the
          processing order is important and again systems vary.
          Sometimes the processing order in each layer or node can
          be altered and sometimes not. When the processing order
          of tools is fixed, the colorist needs to use more
          layers/nodes to achieve the same result.</p>
          <p class="indent">The above tools are all RGB. The 3
          channels can be ganged together and used to manage
          brightness levels. This is called the Master control by
          colorists. Alternatively, each color channel can be
          adjusted separately either by a ball or circle or with a
          knob or slider. Adjusting individual channels allows
          balancing or neutralizing a color bias but is also used
          to create a look or style. Three channel RGB tools are
          commonly referred to as Primaries, not to be confused
          with RGB color space primaries.</p>
          <p class="indent">In output-referred grading these
          primary adjustments are made to bring the image to a
          viewable state on the reference monitor in lieu of an
          output transform, whereas in scene-referred grading their
          result is subsequently processed through the output
          transform, which alters the effect of the controls. The
          decisions are based on aesthetics but intended to be
          neutral. The only definitive information in the image is
          an unexposed black, the precise values of all other tones
          and colors are unknown in the absence of Look
          Management.</p>
          <p class="indent">The colorist crafts the Look after the
          initial technical grade using more refined and
          sophisticated tools. Secondary controls are used in
          conjunction with external mattes, keys, and shapes to
          achieve selective changes. The DI grade is built up in
          layers or nodes, depending on the interface, which can be
          interconnected and blended together. The secondary
          controls can be used as part of the Look, or to modify
          it. For example, if the Look is dark and moody it is
          common practice to use secondaries to brighten skin
          tones.</p>
          <p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a href=

          Sometimes, grading will require external mattes for CG
          shots, so it is advisable to discuss the need for alpha
          channel or separate mattes ahead of delivery. The mattes
          used for grading may not exactly match those used in
          compositing and can, therefore, incur additional
          costs.</p>
          <p class="indent">A sampling of mattes from WreckIt Ralph
          2 used to enhance DI grading. Image ?Disney. All Rights
          Reserved. Animation especially can generate and utilize
          large numbers of mattes allowing the colorist to isolate
          individual characters and even specific features such as
          hair and eyes for fine corrections. It is not unusual to
          have more than 30 mattes per scene in animated features.
          Mattes also allow the colorist to separate foreground and
          background elements, and to rebalance lighting, further
          improving the continuity of shots even after rendering
          has been completed. This can save time that would
          otherwise be spent on multiple render iterations. When
          the Look has already been established early in animation
          pre-production and there is a process in place for notes
          to be recorded during production lighting reviews, the
          colorist generally starts from a position that is very
          close to the expectations of the art directors and can
          focus time on addressing the specific notes that were
          recorded during reviews.</p>
          <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a href="#x29-1190003.7.4"
          id="x29-1190003.7.4">DI Grading Workflows</a></h5>
          <p class="noindent">There are as many workflows for DI
          grading as there are for VFX. Some start as early as
          pre-production, some involve live grades during
          production and some do not assign the finishing colorist
          until quite late in the project. Collaboration between
          VFX and the Color department always pays dividends. If
          the grade begins after VFX, which is not unusual, then
          plates are likely to be delivered as camera files and
          need neutralizing. Without a clear direction of the final
          look, flexibility and latitude are even more critical. If
          a colorist is on board in time, look creation will have
          at least begun, and it is reasonable to expect
          neutralized plates from the Color department. The file
          format and viewing arrangements can vary according to
          time, budget and complexity, but scene-referred plates
          without the look applied are recommended. An ACES EXR
          file is the most reliable option. While CDLs are good for
          providing a general direction for the Look, they are
          quite limited in scope. A 3D LUT can achieve more
          selective changes but is less useful in communicating
          alterations. It is possible to use a CDL and a LUT
          providing all parties can handle both. There are bespoke
          and proprietary tools which work well, are more precise
          and better for communicating change, but again only
          useful if all parts of the process are compatible. Even
          with good planning, seeing shots on a big calibrated
          screen in a controlled environment often reveals things
          for the first time and adjustments have to be made.
          Highlights that distract from the action might need
          dulling, or an important part of the image might need
          enhancing to bring more attention to it. These changes
          might cause a ripple effect and other elements might then
          need matching back to the new tweaks. Color finishing is
          fluid and ultimately where all the pieces of a project
          come together.</p>
          <p class="indent">In animation, Look Management is
          usually settled at the start of production rather than at
          the end of post-production. The Look is much more likely
          to remain consistent up to and including the mastering
          stages of the DI grade. The DI Grade for animation is
          expected to focus on scene-to-scene continuity and
          smaller adjustments to highlight story points, less so on
          crafting the full look of a sequence or project.</p>
          <p class="indent">Look Management should determine the
          methods by which elements are monitored and quality
          checked. It is, of course, appropriate to use waveforms,
          vectorscopes, and histograms to measure scene-referred
          values, but it is often reassuring to also see something
          output-referred. Since different approaches for
          output-referred previews produce very different results,
          a common method is invaluable. The test image from the
          previous section Section 3.6.4.1 DI Grading Tools was
          also processed with different color management solutions
          to demonstrate the risk of mixed approaches.</p>
          <p class="indent">ARRI LogC image with ARRI LUT applied
          and no color correction. Image ? Geoff Boyle All rights
          reserved. This first example is the most obvious and in
          some ways the truest to capture. It uses a LUT supplied
          by the camera manufacturer to optimize chromaticity and
          prepare the image for the EOTF of a Rec. 709 display. The
          ramp shows that the LUT tone maps all possible values
          without clipping. The result is better chroma separation
          and saturation than the primary grade examples, but also
          a flatter image. In fact, this representation is probably
          the most accurate and would serve as a good starting
          point for grading. In the DI grade color trims can be
          applied before the LUT, which keeps the process truly
          scene-referred. However, it is also common practice in
          television grades to color grade after the LUT. Grades
          after the LUT are output-referred and, as discussed
          previously may limit the ability to recover highlight and
          shadow detail. Additionally they cannot be used with a
          different output transform to target other display
          formats.</p>

          project grading is always scene-referred because the OT
          is managed by project settings rather than as a grading
          node. This lack of ambiguity is one more reason that ACES
          is considered the simplest, most reliable form of color
          management by so many. A cinematographer using ACES to
          monitor on set can be certain that VFX and DI grading can
          display the images exactly as seen when shot.</p>
          <p class="indent">ARRI LogC image with simple color
          management and primary grading. Image ? Geoff Boyle All

          <p class="indent">This image is the result of a simple
          color management system in which the source and working
          color space are set to LogC ALEXA Wide Gamut and the
          output is set as 2.4 gamma Rec. 709 and all grading is,
          therefore, scene-referred with minimal transforms. Since
          there is no tone mapping applied by the color management
          it was necessary to use a small Gain adjustment to bring
          the image out of clipping. This was done by taking the
          brightest pixels, the highlights on the flower, and
          bringing them down just out of clipping. The resulting
          image has the lowest contrast of all the tests and shows
          details even in the dark skin. The shadows on the pale
          skin are so light that the look is rather unnatural. The
          chroma separation and saturation are well defined and
          clean. This would make a decent starting point for a
          commercial or a Look for beauty products but because the
          color management alone does not tone map the entire
          dynamic range to that of the display. Exposures higher
          than the test image would appear clipped on a Rec. 709
          display, even though the source data might not be
          clipped.</p>
          <p class="indent">The results from using different color
          tools or color management would cause for confusing
          conversations at best, but the greater concern is that
          finished scenes could be hard to match in the final
          conform because although they were created
          scene-referred, they were seen differently when they were
          created. Even the decision to apply tweaks to an
          otherwise standard color managed pipeline is a material
          fact that can considerably affect the time taken to
          achieve the DI grade and can in extreme cases necessitate
          a late change to the established look in order to hide
          discrepancies that were not seen in the creation
          stages.</p>
          <p class="indent">The above examples are not in any way
          exhaustive but clearly demonstrate the importance of Look
          Management. All of the examples are valid viewing
          transforms without an intentional creative Look applied.
          Any of these methods might be chosen as the starting
          point for crafting a look. Considerations in making that
          choice range from repeatability across multiple software,
          tone mapping capabilities to different display formats,
          and the ability to display good saturation and contrast,
          to the best aesthetic choice for managing the two skin
          tones in the same frame or preserving the hair color most
          accurately. These comparisons are kept simple for
          demonstration purposes. Real world examples could include
          considerably more effort to include an established Look
          on monitored previews. XXX</p>
