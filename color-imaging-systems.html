          Imaging Systems</a></h3>
          <p class="noindent">A color imaging system embodies any
          combination of chemical, electronic and optical
          technologies and devices required to perform image
          capture, signal processing, and image formation. The
          document only scratches the surface of the many possible
          combinations. The HVS is itůself a color imaging system:
          light is captured by the eye, signals are generated and
          an image is formed in the mind. Interested readers should
          refer to Madden and Giorgianni (2007) for a comprehensive
          publication on color imaging systems.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=

          Capture</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Image formation imposes that a signal
          was captured and processed in the first place. In section
          2.3.2, spectroradiometers, spectrophotometers, and
          tristimulus colorimeters are presented as the instruments
          used to perform color stimuli measurements in
          Colorimetry.</p>
          <p class="indent">While most of the time they are used to
          perform unrelated color measurements for a single sample,
          they share similar principles and components with cameras
          and telescopes: An entrance slit akin to the tiny
          aperture of pinhole cameras Collimating lenses or mirrors

          <p class="indent">CMOS sensors tend to be cheaper to
          produce, have less power consumption, e.g. 100 times
          less, but usually exhibit more noise than CCD sensors.
          CMOS sensors are typically found in consumer and motion
          pictures cameras while CCD sensors are usually used in
          astrophotography and scientific applications requiring
          the lowest noise profile possible.</p>
          <p class="indent">Both sensor types register photons
          hits, which upon conversion to electrons are stored into
          charge packets that are then read out.</p>
          <p class="indent">A successful and accurate color imaging
          system must have color reproduction characteristics
          following the HVS, and thus must be trichromatic. Image
          capture devices such as consumer and movie cameras
          attempt to be colorimetric by satisfying the Maxwell-Ives
          criterion which states that their spectral responses,
          i.e. their sensitivities, must be a linear combination of
          the CMFs to reduce metameric failures.</p>
          <p class="indent">Nikon 5100 sensitivities compared to
          HVS cone fundamentals for 2 degrees. In practice, most
          consumer and motion pictures cameras are not
          colorimetric, and compromises are made to increase
          performance such as offsetting the red response of the
          sensor to longer wavelengths to reduce the noise arising
          from a peak centered like those of the L cones.</p>
          <p class="indent">Traditionally, photographs and movies
          were captured using photographic film. However, with the
          digital transition and advent of digital capture in the
          2000s, this practice is nowadays becoming rarer thus it
          will not be described in favor of electronic color
          imaging systems.</p>
          <p class="indent">While some high-end camera systems use
          an expensive set of three dichroic filters, three CCD
          sensors and, a beam-splitter prism, the vast majority of
          consumer and motion pictures cameras adopt a Bayer Color
          Filter Array (CFA) with a single sensor. The Bayer CFA is
          an arrangement of colored filters over the sensor
          photosites. The exact bandpass characteristics of the
          filters vary between cameras, but they are designed to
          transmit red, green and blue light. Because the HVS
          sensitivity peaks at 555nm, there are twice as many green
          filtered photosites as there are red or blue. This Bayer
          CFA was invented by Bryce Bayer at Eastman Kodak and
          patented in 1976. It empowered the production of much
          cheaper and compact image capturing systems at the price
          of reduced image quality due to the loss in spatial
          resolution and increased noise.</p>

          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">2.7.2</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-21-74" id="x21-740002.7.2">Signal
          Processing</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">The raw image data must be processed
          to be displayed. Multiple operations are performed in
          succession until the image is ready. However, there is
          not a single, and unique path to that end and two cameras
          or raw processing applications might take different ways
          for a similar result. A typical process may adopt those
          steps: Linearization Black Level Subtraction White Level
          Scaling Clipping White Balancing Demosaicing Conversion
          to Working RGB Color Space With raw image captured by a
          Bayer CFA camera already linearly encoded or whose data
          is already linearized, the thermal black encoding level
          must be subtracted. The black subtracted image data is
          then rescaled in range 0-1 with the scale factor being
          the inverse of the difference between the white level,
          i.e. the saturation encoding level, point after which the
          sensor behaves non-linearly, or camera circuitry
          introduces clipping, and the maximum black level for a
          given channel. The scaled image is clipped so that no
          values are outside range 0-1.</p>
          <p class="indent">The clipped image is white balanced so
          that achromatic colors of the scene stay neutral once
          reproduced. The process is similar to the HVS chromatic
          adaptation ability. Viggiano and Henrietta (2004)
          compared the accuracy of various white balancing methods
          and found "that the illuminant-dependent characterization
          produced the best results, sharpened camera RGB and
          native camera RGB were next best, XYZ and Von Kries were
          often not far behind, and balancing in the -709 primaries
          was significantly worse."</p>
          <p class="indent">The Von Kries chromatic adaptation
          method is described because of its widespread usage in
          other contexts such as conversion between RGB color space
          with different white points. It involves converting the
          image to a LMS color space representing the cone
          fundamentals sensitivities and perform gain adjustments
          on each one of the Long, Medium and Short components as
          follows:</p>
          <p class="indent">Where L’, M’, S’ are the white-balanced
          LMS cone values, Lw, Mw, Sw are the LMS cone values of a
          reference achromatic object in the scene, e.g. a perfect
          white diffuser, and L, M, S are the non white-balanced
          LMS cone values. The conversion from CIE XYZ tristimulus
          values to LMS color space is performed with a chromatic
          adaptation matrix such as Bradford or CAT02.</p>
          <p class="indent">CAT02 chromatic adaptation matrix.</p>
          <p class="indent">Once white balanced, the image must
          then be demosaiced to produce RGB pixel values for all
          the photosites. Many different demosaicing algorithms
          exist to estimate the values for the two unrecorded
          channels at each photosite. Fast ones, such as bilinear
          interpolation, used in real-time applications or for
          previewing purposes and editorial. Algorithms such as
          Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed (AHD) from Hirakawa and
          Parks (2005) or Demosaicing With Directional Filtering
          and a posteriori Decision (DDFAPD) from Menon (2007)
          produce much higher quality results but are slower. In
          the context of digital imagery that will be heavily
          post-processed, it is often preferable to use a
          demosaicing algorithm producing softer results and thus
          less prone to edge artifacts and then add sharpening
          selectively as part of the finishing process.</p>
          <p class="indent">Upon demosaicing, the resulting image
          must be mapped from its native color space, often
          referred to as Camera RGB, to the CIE XYZ color space or
          any relevant RGB color space. The transformation is
          usually performed using a 3x3 matrix applied to the
          linear Camera RGB values. This matrix is the result of
          the camera characterization process described in section
          4.8. and is ordinarily given by the camera makers or
          third-party organizations such as Adobe Systems with
          their camera .dcp profiles or the A.M.P.A.S with some of
          their ACES Input Device Transforms (IDT).</p>
          <p class="indent">At this stage, the image is almost
          ready to be displayed: It requires a Look Transform and
          Output Transform as described in sections 3.1.3 and 3.14
          to be faithfully represented.</p>

          Formation</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Image formation is the final stage of
          a color imaging system. The processed image signals are
          used to drive the display device color-forming elements:
          the display primaries.</p>
          <p class="indent">As indicated in section 2.3.9, the vast
          majority of modern electronic display devices use an
          additive image formation process: from the venerable CRT
          to the high-end modern phosphor laser cinema projector,
          and including LCD, plasma, OLED and DLP. Display
          primaries of a consumer smartphone and a consumer tablet.
          Spectral data courtesy of fluxometer.com. LCD, plasma and
          OLED displays form images using red, green and blue light
          emitting adjacent elements. The colors are mixed when the
          light emitted by each element reaches the observer HVS,
          and overlaps onto the retina to generate the final color
          stimuli.</p>
          <p class="indent">On the other hand, DLP and projectors
          form images by combining modulated red, green and blue
          light directly on the projection screen, creating the
          final color stimuli and reflecting it toward the observer
          HVS.</p>
