          <p class="noindent">There are an ever increasing number
          of file formats, many of which support a variety of
          encodings, so some common sense is needed when choosing
          between them. Usually, it is best to minimize transforms
          and conversions, so sticking to as few file formats as
          possible is generally best.</p>
          <p class="indent">Given production, post-production, and
          delivery have very different requirements, they would
          justifiably have different file formats. Production and
          image capture need a file format with minimal compression
          and maximum information. For real-time capture write
          speeds are important and large file sizes are common.
          Post-production is more interested in moving and
          processing information than production, so there is some
          pressure to reduce the file size, but also to have easy
          read encoding. It is still important to preserve maximum
          information, but more efficient encodings are typical.
          XXX Delivery formats are mostly dictated by the end
          client and should match their archive and distribution
          architecture. Since many of the bigger organizations are
          heavily invested in their libraries and archives, changes
          to delivery formats are slower than in other areas.
          Storage and flexibility are the driving forces for
          distribution, so heavier compression and display referred
          files are most common. However, some companies are now
          asking for ungraded and/or scene-referred masters along
          with metadata for versioning. XXX</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">4.10.1</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-43-171" id=
          "x43-1700004.10.1">DPX</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">DPX is a SMPTE standardized image
          format that is commonly used in the motion-picture
          industry. While the DPX format supports a variety of
          pixel types including float32, it is most commonly
          associated with uncompressed 10 bit and 16 bit unsigned
          integer RGB imagery. Unlike EXR - which is synonymous
          with scene-referred linear colorimetry, DPX does not have
          a canonical color space. It is common for DPX to store
          any number of integer camera log encodings, in addition
          to broadcast-ready Rec. 709. Generally, if you’ve got a
          DPX file the only way to know for sure what you have is
          through communication with the person who created it, or
          detailed forensic analysis failing that. DPX has limited
          metadata support, including a few settings related to
          colorimetry, but beware these flags. Even under the best
          of intentions DPX metadata is rarely preserved for
          long.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">4.10.2</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-43-172" id=
          "x43-1710004.10.2">EXR</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">OpenEXR is an open-source image
          format created by ILM in 1999, which has near universal
          adoption in the VFX and animation industries. OpenEXR is
          intended for storing floating point, scene-referred
          linear imagery. Although OpenEXR was not the first image
          format suitable for storing HDR float data, it is the
          most popular in film production due to its efficient
          lossless compression codecs, support for 16 bit half
          float pixel type and support for other features such as
          data window/display window tracking, multiple layers,
          deep frame buffers, rich metadata encoding, and the lack
          of legacy format baggage.</p>
          <p class="indent">In our experience, the half data format
          is sufficient for color images, color channels being
          those viewed using tone rendering, examples of which
          include beauty renders, specular color, diffuse color,
          per-light color AOVs, etc. For data channels requiring
          high precision representations of physical attributes,
          such as depth, normals or control maps, full 32 bit float
          is available and often necessary.</p>
          <p class="indent">The maximum value for float-16 is
          65504.0f. The minimum positive value that can be
          represented without a decrease in numerical precision, is
          6.1035e-05f. It is important to remember when dealing
          with floating-point data, that the bits are allocated
          very differently from integer encodings. Whereas integer
          encodings have a uniform allocation of bits over the
          entire coding space, the floating-point encodings have
          increased precision in the low end and decreased
          precision in the high end. Consequently, if one has an
          unsigned 16 bit integer image, converts to a float-16
          representation, and then converts back, fewer than 16
          bits of precision are maintained.</p>
          <p class="indent">OpenEXR supports a variety of
          compression options. Piz (wavelet) probably offers the
          highest lossless compression ratio on grainy material but
          is relatively expensive computationally. The zip options
          offer a reasonable compression ratio on
          computer-generated elements and is less computationally
          intense. The b44 codec is lossy; intended for real-time
          playback. OpenEXR also can store a tiled, mipmapped
          representation, and is thus suitable for use as a
          renderer texture format. OpenEXR 2.0 added deep buffer
          support: an arbitrary number of depth-samples per pixels,
          at the expense of increased storage requirements.</p>
          <p class="indent">Because image data stored in OpenEXR
          files is normally scene-referred linear, a viewing
          transform is required to display the image. Metadata can
          be included which specifies the primaries of the image
          data but as with DPX, this metadata should not be trusted
          in general. A naive transform to an output-referred space
          such as sRGB will clip any data above 1.0. As part of the
          ACES standardization effort, a constrained version of
          OpenEXR was specified in SMPTE as ST 2065-4:2013. This
          standard specifies the on-disk bit representation of
          image data and critical metadata. One of the metadata
          fields specified in ST 2065-4 is the "ACES Image
          Container" flag which is intended to indicate an OpenEXR
          image is a compliant ST 2065-4 file. ACES ST 2065-4 files
          are encoded as scene-referred linear images using the AP0
          primaries and should be viewed through an ACES output
          transform. This ensures that anybody viewing the image
          sees it in a way which perceptually matches what any
          other viewer sees, independent of display or viewing
          environment. XXX</p>
