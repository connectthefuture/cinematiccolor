          Look</a></h3>
          <p class="noindent">The visual style or Look of a
          production is integral to the audience’s experience of
          the media, be it live-action, animation or game. It
          evolves from pre-production through to delivery and can
          be modified anywhere in the pipeline. In live-action, the
          Look is often adjusted, finessed and approved in the DI
          grade, which is the final stage of post-production. In
          animation and games, the overall process is very similar
          except that the finished Look is established earlier on
          during content development and a final DI grade is less
          common or less impactful to the Look.</p>
          <p class="indent">The Look is the product of design,
          lighting, and grading. Crafting the Look involves many
          collaborators, many ideas and many processes. In order to
          view camera and CG scene-referred content in a meaningful
          way, it is important to add an approximation of the Look
          and an output transform that matches the display in use.
          Look Management is the process of accurately
          communicating the intended Look throughout
          production.</p>
          <p class="indent">The existence of a look should always
          be considered even if it is not explicitly defined in a
          color pipeline. The earlier the Look is established the
          more decisions on lighting, VFX and editing are based on
          a common understanding. Even without making a choice, the
          project still has a look.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.3.1</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-25-84" id=
          "x25-840003.3.1">Establishing the Look</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Design influences in pre-production
          begin with the producers and director discussing ideas.
          The Look begins with these ideas and concepts, sometimes
          collected in the form of a design scrapbook. In
          live-action, the Directory of Photography (DP), costume
          and set designers, makeup, the post-production
          supervisor, concept artists, and others then work
          together to develop an early version of the Look, which
          is then built into a look transform as a LUT, ASC Color
          Decision List (CDL) or other similar proprietary formats.
          These early discussions drive the selection of cameras,
          lighting, stages, locations, costumes and image
          processing. Sometimes extensive camera and DI grading
          tests are made to confirm viability or assist in the
          decision-making process, but usually, ideas remain
          relatively fluid in the early period. The director’s
          scrapbook often helps to communicate the influences as
          well as the intent.</p>
          <p class="indent">A selection of final images from
          live-action visual effects, animation and games. The look
          of each is driven by the creative direction of the
          production. In this small selection, you can see a
          variety of choices around contrast, saturation and
          dominant colors. Images are 2018 MARVEL, Disney/Pixar,

          <p class="indent">If the Look evolves progressively from
          an established concept, through Look Management, and into
          the DI grade it results in higher quality deliverables
          and can also save a great deal of time, effort and money.
          Even with the most careful Look Management, there are
          likely to be many modifications in the final stage, the
          DI grade. More of this is discussed later in the 3.6 DI
          Grading. Sometimes the colorist may be asked to
          dramatically diverge from the original artistic intent,
          and this may be for any number of reasons.</p>

          look (bottom) 2018 MARVEL Once source images exist it is
          up to Look Management to enable all the contributors to
          view the images as intended, then for DI grading to
          perfect the Look on a scene by scene basis and to manage
          elements within each frame if necessary. The DI colorist
          is also responsible for managing any differences that
          occur as a result of different color gamut, dynamic range
          or resolution in the final delivery versions. There are
          two schools of thought on this. Some studios prefer that
          all versions are as similar as possible and are prepared
          to surrender the extremes of gamut and dynamic range to
          ensure that. Others seek to exploit the full use of
          high-dynamic range and wide color gamuts even though the
          differences between delivery versions are more
          apparent.</p>
          <p class="indent">Crafting the Look in the widest color
          space, highest dynamic range and highest resolution
          provides a more future proof master deliverable,
          especially if the project remains scene-referred. Some
          organisations use this as a marketing differentiator.
          Lighting, makeup and production design decisions for an
          HDR screen master are very different to those made for an
          SDR television master, so it is best to consider the
          primary target display technology as early as
          possible.</p>

          Lucasfilm Ltd. All Rights Reserved In some productions,
          particularly in animation, the Look is set in early
          pre-production, with a little latitude for DI grading
          allowed to help continuity and atmosphere. There are
          situations when the Look may be quite different for some
          deliverables, e.g. for HDR Displays, or the Look may
          evolve over time, for example, TV series can look
          different between early seasons. These may need to be
          better matched for box sets later on. Often, the Look is
          not fully defined until the DI grading stage and then the
          extra flexibility of source referred VFX elements is
          advantageous. The Look can change even if the final DI
          colorist is involved from the very start either on-set or
          for the dailies. Changes to contrast, color or brightness
          might behave differently on CG material compared to
          camera sourced media. Whilst it is the intent in an ideal
          world that CG elements exactly match the scene-referred
          pixel values that the live-action camera would have
          captured, in reality, the capture process itself may have
          variations. Then the colorist has to correct for
          continuity as well as apply the Look. Differences between
          elements are also likely to occur if the Look Management
          is not applied correctly across all departments and
          facilities.</p>

          Images are Geoff Boyle The responsibility of approving
          the Look can fall to the producer, director,
          cinematographer, colorist, VFX supervisor. Sometimes even
          the editor is involved. Often there are disagreements on
          the Look and the way it is interpreted scene-to-scene.
          For that reason, it helps to clarify whose vision the
          post-production team are working towards. Without clear
          direction, much time will be lost preparing alternate
          versions or re-rendering fixes in the final DI grade as
          decisions change. Whoever makes the decisions on the
          Look, someone then has to take responsibility for it
          through to delivery. That is usually either the Director
          of Photography or the colorist. The senior colorist is
          likely to be more accessible but may not be appointed
          until much later in the post-production timetable. Whilst
          there is a strong tendency for everyone to become
          familiar and comfortable with the Look set in the color
          managed pipeline it can happen that quite significant
          changes are made at the final grading stages in order to
          better communicate an impression to the audience. Often
          the full resolution images are not seen on a large
          calibrated display in the edited sequence until the DI
          master grade when there is no longer an obligation to use
          reversible transforms. The DI colorist can then finesse
          each scene to work within the Look or tweak the Look to
          better convey the artistic intent.</p>
          <p class="indent">The Look for animation is guided by
          artwork created in visual development. Translating the
          creative style into a Look that can be applied to CG
          animation is an iterative process utilizing render tests
          of neutrally lit character rigs as well as more complete
          scenes that are representative of the storytelling
          environment. In a facility where there is a history of
          previous Looks, one of these may be selected as a
          starting point for further development. It can also help
          to start with a relatively neutral look before
          incorporating specific creative touches. A neutral look
          is useful for verifying the technical quality of renders
          and the accuracy of physical simulations.</p>

          <p class="indent">The initial pass at the Look tries to
          establish the desired contrast and overall shape of the
          tone curve along with the appropriate level of color
          saturation. Once this is established more specific
          adjustments can be made to dial in characteristics such
          as the behavior of bright highlights and shadow detail. A
          controlled amount of color distortion may be desirable
          sometimes, for example, to lend warmth to highlights.
          These fine adjustments may not be easy to make with a
          general test image, but can be made more obvious by
          selecting the right image content. Characters are
          particularly useful for fine-tuning the appearance of
          facial contours, highlights in the hair and the overall
          reproduction of skin tones, while environments are useful
          for evaluating color relationships and setting the
          behavior of very bright light sources. Because the final
          viewed color is a product of both the rendered or
          captured image and the Look it is viewed through, it is
          important to set the Look early so that changes do not
          impact approved images once production is underway. Once
          a base Look has been set for the movie, it may also be
          complemented by secondary Looks to support the story as
          it shifts into different environments.</p>

          Electronic Arts Inc. All rights reserved. The Look for a
          games project is established in much the same way as for
          an animated feature. Tests using environments and
          characters are run to establish the desired contrast,
          saturation and overall shape of any S-curve that may be
          required (if any). In the context of a game, a Look has
          to serve not just the vision of the art director but also
          the goals of the gameplay designers. If a Look is overly
          contrasty, it may interfere with gameplay by making
          enemies hiding in shadows effectively invisible to the
          player. By the same token, if the tone curve’s shoulder
          is too abrupt, the detail in the highlights may be lost,
          which can hinder gameplay if bright objects or enemies
          can’t be differentiated from bright skies or lights.
          Content is often validated against the game Look as well
          as a neutral Look. Since games are real-time and often
          built as a result of rapid iteration, the ability to
          change is held in high regard and thus content may be
          reused in multiple very different Looks. For example,
          gameplay may require a different Look for low health, or
          the game may be played at different times of day. Thus
          validating the content holds up in both the target Look
          and a neutral Look gives confidence the lighting or Look
          can be changed without requiring significant asset
          rework. Checking content in a neutral and
          project-specific Look mirrors animation and live-action
          workflows.</p>
          <p class="indent">Games can be made with fairly small
          teams and as such, one person may perform many separate
          roles. There is generally no one person who tends to own
          Look creation, though the art director will typically
          drive it and make the final call to sign off on assets,
          lighting and Look adjustments made by a team of artists.
          One difference with live-action and animation is that
          because game engines generate new images every time the
          game is played, the opportunity to change and refine the
          Look extends even closer to the time when the audience
          sees the finished frames even tuning it to suit the
          individual display being used. By association, they have
          less ability to fall back to manually created and
          fine-tuned trim passes like visual effects and animation
          projects to optimize the display quality for different
          displays’ dynamic range and gamut. Although broad
          operating parameters can be set for the engine to work
          within and interpolate accordingly. Efforts such as the
          “HDR Gaming Interest Group” (HGIG) aim to optimize the
          images generated to best utilize the characteristics of
          each display.</p>
          <p class="indent">Key Points Even without making a
          choice, each project has its Look. The Look influences
          audience perception of imagery. The earlier the Look is
          established the more effective it is implemented. Testing
          with a neutral look is useful for verifying technical
          quality and accuracy The base Look may be complemented by
          secondary looks for some scenes</p>

          id="x25-850003.3.1">Displaying Scene-Referred
          Imagery</a></h5>
          <p class="noindent">One of the complexities associated
          with scene-referred imagery is display reproduction.
          While scene-referred imagery is natural for processing,
          displays can only reproduce a much lower dynamic (LDR)
          range. While at first glance it seems like a reasonable
          approach to directly map scene-referred linear directly
          to the display, at least for the overlapping portions of
          the contrast range, in practice this yields unpleasing
          results. See “Color Management for Digital Cinema”
          Giorgianni (2005), for further justification, and Section
          3.2 for a visual example.</p>
          <p class="indent">This challenge has been approached and
          intuitively solved by artists for millena. The world is a
          high dynamic range environment. Artists have striven to
          render artistic versions of reality on low dynamic range
          media. In the color community, there are many aspects to
          pleasingly reproducing high dynamic range pixels on a low
          dynamic range display, but one of the most important is
          known as tone mapping and is an active area of research.
          Surprisingly, many pleasing tonal renditions of
          high-dynamic range data to low dynamic range displays use
          similarly shaped transforms. On first glance this may be
          surprising, but when one sits down and designs a tone
          rendering transform there are convergent processes at
          work corresponding to what yields a pleasing image
          appearance. Other considerations for reproducing high
          dynamic range on low dynamic range displays include gamut
          mapping, highlight bleaching and saturation changes.</p>
          <p class="indent">First, most tone renderings map a
          traditional scene grey exposure to a central value on the
          output display. Directly mapping the remaining
          scene-referred linear image to display results in an
          image with low apparent contrast as a consequence of the
          display surround. Thus, one adds a reconstruction slope
          greater than 1:1 to bump the mid-tone contrast. Of
          course, with this increase, in contrast, the shadows and
          highlights are severely clipped, so a roll-off in
          contrast of lower than 1:1 is applied on both the high
          and low ends to allow for highlight and shadow detail to
          have smooth transitions. With this high contrast portion
          in the middle and low contrast portions at the extrema,
          the final curve resembles an “S” shape as shown
          below.</p>
          <p class="indent">The ACES sRGB Output Transform applied
          to a ramp in the ACEScc color space. An “S-shaped” curve
          is traditionally used to cinematically tone render
          scene-referred HDR colorimetry into an image suitable for
          output on a low dynamic range display. The input axis is
          an ACEScc logarithmic base 2 coding of scene-referred
          linear pixels. The output axis corresponds to code-values
          for an sRGB display.</p>
          <p class="indent">The final transfer curve from
          scene-referred linear to display is shockingly consistent
          between technologies, with both digital and film imaging
          pipelines having roughly matched end to end transforms.
          If a film color process is characterized from negative to
          print, it almost exactly produces this “S-shaped”
          transfer curve, which is not surprising given the
          pleasant tonal reproductions film offers. In traditional
          film imaging process, the negative stock captures a wide
          dynamic range and the print stock imparts a very pleasing
          tone mapping for reproduction on limited dynamic range
          devices (the theatrical print “positive”). Broadly
          speaking, film negatives encode an HDR scene-referred
          image, and the print embodies an output-referred tone
          mapping. For those interested in further details on the
          high-dynamic range imaging processes implicit in the film
          development process, see the Ansel Adams Photography
          Series [Adams 84].</p>
          <p class="indent">It should be noted that while there is
          significant convergence on filmic tone mapping, a filmic
          curve may not be desirable in games, tv or film.
          Productions choosing to reproduce a particularly stylized
          visual, such as a cartoony or highly ambient-lit
          appearance, may not wish to see the additional contrast
          or toe from such an operator, so may elect to have a less
          pronounced curve.</p>
          <p class="indent">To summarize, it is strongly advised
          not to directly map high-dynamic range scene-referred
          data to the display. A tone rendering is required, and
          there is great historical precedence for using a global
          “S-Shaped” operator. HDR scene-acquisition accurately
          records a wide range of scene-luminance values, and with
          a proper tone mapping operator, much of this range can be
          visually preserved during reproduction on low-dynamic
          range devices.</p>
          <p class="indent">Please refer to Section 3.2 for a
          visual comparison between an S-shaped tone mapping
          operator versus a simple gamma transform.</p>
          <p class="indent">Specific considerations taken into
          account when crafting the Look for a film, animation or
          game are discussed later in 3.6 DI Grading</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.3.2</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-25-86" id="x25-860003.3.2">Look
          Management</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Locking down the Look early on is a
          critical first step in crafting cinematic images, as it
          underpins every other part of the process. The remainder
          of the pipeline relies on visualizations that are created
          by working, translating or transcoding the Look and this
          is known as Look Management.</p>
          <p class="indent">An overview of the filmmaking process
          shows that Look Management is core to each stage. The
          mistaken belief that the Look is the product of just the
          DP during shooting, or the colorist during mastering
          discourages a well-managed pipeline, without which the
          visual effects process is rather in the dark. Decisions
          earlier in the chain cannot easily be protected without a
          carefully color managed pipeline. Meaningful tests should
          be performed early on, saving a lot of work and some
          potentially unpleasant surprises later. In high-end
          productions changes to the Look can be suggested all
          through post-production and communicated to everyone else
          via color decision lists of some sort. The CDL is one
          such mechanism but is quite limited in scope, there are
          other more complex proprietary solutions in use.</p>
          <p class="indent">When a look is applied to imagery as it
          is captured or saved to disk, it’s called “baking the
          Look”. The Look should not be baked in at the source or
          early in post-production. If the Look is baked in early,
          all the problems of output-referred workflows are very
          apparent, especially if the Look is strong. Continuity is
          more difficult and there is very little latitude to alter
          or modify the Look later on. Exposures, color balance,
          and lighting have to be close to perfect since there is
          little more information for the colorist to use in the
          final stages. VFX could still be delivered
          scene-referred, but the expectation is that they match
          the main content. Delivering to multiple formats is still
          possible, but usually, any differences that take
          advantage of wider tonal range or color gamut are
          severely limited. It is strongly recommended that the
          Look is NOT baked in until the final DI grading
          stage.</p>
          <p class="indent">Working with multiple gamuts is a
          subject that can’t be avoided for a show of even moderate
          complexity. Almost every camera has a different encoding
          gamut. The working gamut used for a show will likely be
          distinct from any of the camera encoding gamuts. The
          working gamut will also likely be distinct from the final
          output display gamut. This is guaranteed if the show will
          be seen on multiple types of displays. The advent of the
          multi-gamut workflow has added an additional layer of
          complexity to setting up a project and communicating
          between artists, departments and companies. As such, it
          is especially important to define the choice of gamuts to
          be used for capture, grading, lighting, rendering,
          compositing, and final display as early as possible and
          to agree on how and when the gamut choices should be
          presented to users. For many artists, a successful setup
          will be one where they aren’t aware of the gamuts being
          used. OpenColorIO (2003)’s “role” feature allows some of
          these choices to be safely hidden from artists. It is
          very easy to get lost in a thicket of similar, but not
          quite matching, gamuts if images and color data aren’t
          properly tracked or labeled.</p>
          <p class="indent">One of the benefits of ACES in the
          world of multiple gamuts is that it provides a clear
          standard for mapping between the different sets of gamuts
          used for cameras, rendering, compositing, grading, and
          final output.</p>
          <p class="indent">The choice of working gamut affects the
          feel of controls and operations that affect color.
          Choosing a space that is too wide may break some
          operators, like keyers, or may just make otherwise
          familiar operators and controls feel unfamiliar to
          artists. Working in the camera encoding gamut may be
          useful for these jobs. For some operations, a compositor
          may transform to the camera encoding gamut, apply the
          operation and then transform back to the working gamut.
          This is similar in spirit to the time-honored trick of
          resizing in log described in 3.5.4 Working with Log
          Imagery.</p>
          <p class="indent">When the reference Look is created in a
          DI grading system, the process is saved just as it is in
          case it needs to be modified or used to derive other
          looks. The Look itself is sampled in a 3D LUT format that
          can be loaded into color managed applications. Because
          some applications have specific requirements for the LUT
          formatting, it is not unusual to generate multiple LUTs.
          However, it is preferable to find a common LUT format
          that works with as many applications as possible with a
          high fidelity. Exporting the Look as a LUT is the easiest
          way to share it but using a parameter based method such
          as CDL is also an option for simpler looks. Many
          facilities use the combination of a show LUT with a CDL
          in front of it.</p>
          <p class="indent">Once the Look has been established for
          a CG animation project the process that created it is
          saved just as it is in DI grading systems. The best
          solution is to use a color management system, like
          OpenColorIO, that is shared across all the applications
          and can apply Looks contextually. This allows for a high
          degree of automation in Look Management and can help
          eliminate operator error. Tagging images with metadata
          can assist this system by automatically managing looks
          across productions and also within a production when
          multiple looks are employed. A good color management
          system should be able to generate notes that can feedback
          to artists working at their desktops and also feed
          forward to the colorist for DI grading.</p>
          <p class="indent">Games tend to be produced primarily
          using a single toolset, the “engine”. Within the engine
          itself, color management is largely handled
          automatically, being a single piece of software. For
          assets that are created externally to the engine, like
          textures and sometimes materials, it is desirable to have
          a representation of the Look of the project that can be
          used in the authoring packages used for those assets for
          validation purposes. In this case it is common to export
          a LUT or other representation of the Look, much like
          animation and live-action. Color management must also be
          handled with defined import/export paths allowing
          management of externally created content, ideally via
          similar tools to VFX/Animation but are sometimes handled
          manually.</p>
          <p class="indent">Key Points Look Management visualises
          the Look through production and post-production
          Irreversibly applying the Look is called “baking in the
          Look” The Look should not be baked in until the final DI
          grading stage Look Management should consider multiple
          gamut sources and deliverables Metadata is crucial for
          good Look Management</p>
