          (ACES)</a></h3>
          <p class="noindent">The Academy of Motion Picture Arts
          and Sciences has defined a standard for scene-referred
          linear floating-point workflow components and best
          practices, the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES),
          which is in line with many of the approaches outlined in
          this document. ACES-based workflows define a
          scene-referred working space, and a reference viewing
          transform, in order to standardize floating-point linear
          interchange for moving image content in general and an
          archival master for motion pictures in particular. As
          stated in the introduction, ACES presents an excellent
          embodiment of a general model of color processing that
          will be mirrored in most of the examples discussed in
          this paper. ACES will be referenced throughout this
          document because it is open, well-documented and widely
          available. It provides a great starting point for
          exploration. This should not be taken as a suggestion
          that ACES is the only option. The decisions about which
          color transforms and spaces to use should be based on the
          requirements and constraints of a given project.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.2.1</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-24-80" id="x24-790003.2.1">Input
          Transforms</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Input Transforms, previously referred
          to as Input Device Transforms or IDTs, for specific
          cameras, convert input colorimetry to a scene-referred
          linear wide gamut working space, ACES2065-1. Camera
          manufacturers typically publish Input Transforms for
          their specific encoding gamuts and transfer
          functions.</p>
          <p class="indent">Film scans are a special case, where
          the Academy has defined a new density encoding standard,
          the Academy Density Exchange Encoding (ADX), which is
          stored in a DPX file. Both 10- and 16-bit variants of ADX
          are provided, which encode for different negative density
          ranges. The Transform from ADX to ACES2026-1 is not
          film-stock specific, but uses a generic film input
          linearization. The Academy publishes details of the
          transforms from Status M to ADX for a variety of stocks
          in Annex C of Technical Bulletin TB-2014-005.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.2.2</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-24-81" id="x24-800003.2.2">Working
          Space</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">At the core of ACES is the Academy
          Color Encoding Specification, called ACES2065-1 for
          short. This color space is a high-dynamic range,
          scene-referred linear space with a color gamut that
          encompasses that of the human visual system. The color
          gamut is referred to as AP0. ACES2065-1 is a relative,
          rather than absolute, encoding and codes exposed middle
          grey as 0.18. When stored on disk, ACES files are stored
          in a constrained version of the OpenEXR (EXR) format,
          with an ACES Container metadata flag set to identify them
          as such. Standard ACES files are uncompressed half-float,
          but processing in ACES is not necessarily limited to
          half-float.</p>
          <p class="indent">In the ACES workflow, the intent is for
          artistic changes to be made by manipulating the
          scene-referred linear ACES data, as viewed through an
          Output Transform.</p>
          <p class="indent">The two ACES working gamuts - AP0 and
          AP1 While the linear ACES2065-1 space is used for storage
          and interchange of ACES images, it is not an ideal
          working space for all operations. Because the primaries
          of ACES2065-1 (AP0) fall considerably outside the
          spectral locus in order to enclose it entirely, the
          results of using this as an RGB space for CGI rendering
          are less than ideal mathematically and for the user
          experience. See Section 3.4.6.2 for a more in-depth
          discussion. A subsidiary color space, called ACEScg, is
          defined in ACES to address these issues. ACEScgs
          primaries, known as the AP1 gamut, fall only just outside
          the spectral locus. This allows CG renders and
          compositing operations to behave in a more intuitive
          manner.</p>
          <p class="indent">Figure X, The ACEScc and ACEScct
          logarithmic encoding curves</p>
          <p class="indent">Because the math of color grading
          operations likewise does not always work intuitively with
          linear data, ACES defines a pure log working space,
          ACEScc, with AP1 primaries, for grading use. A variant
          with a toe, ACEScct, was added later and reacts to
          grading operations in a manner similar to camera log
          curves, giving the colorist a familiar feel to the
          controls.</p>
          <p class="indent">ACEScg, ACEScc and ACEScct are intended
          only to be transient internal working spaces for 3D,
          compositing and grading systems. None of them are
          intended to be written to files, although some facilities
          do use ACEScg-encoded files for interchange. Care should
          be taken if doing this as image metadata specifying the
          stored color space is notoriously unreliable. This was
          the central motive for having only a single defined
          format for storage on disk, the ACES OpenEXR container
          (ACES2065-4, specified by SMPTE ST.2065-4). An ACEScg
          file incorrectly treated as if it were an ACES2065-1 file
          will not yield the intended result.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.2.3</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-24-82" id="x24-810003.2.3">Look
          Transform</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">In ACES, the look of a project can be
          defined by a Look Transform, previously referred to as a
          Look Modification Transform, or LMT, applied before the
          Output Transform. The advantage of this approach is that
          technically the Look Transform should not have to change
          regardless of whether the Output Transform chosen is for
          a sRGB desktop monitor, a DCI-P3 projector or an HDR TV.
          In practice, a slight trim is often used to compensate
          for different aesthetic choices between display gamuts.
          ACEScc and ACEScct are most commonly used as the space
          for crafting Looks within ACES projects. A Look Transform
          based on a grade in ACEScc or ACEScct should, according
          to the specification, include a transform to that space
          from ACES2065-1 and a transform back to ACES2065-1 at the
          end. Implementations may apply the transform directly in
          the working space, such as ACEScg, rather than in
          ACES2065-1.</p>
          <p class="indent">The Academy Technical Bulletin
          TB-2014-10 describes the application of a Look Transform
          using the Academy Common LUT Format (CLF). Since CLF is
          not yet widely supported, any look applied using a LUT or
          grading operation which spans an entire scene or show,
          and is used in series with per-shot adjustments can be
          considered to be a Look Transform.</p>
          <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class=
          "titlemark">3.2.4</span> <a href=
          "contents.html#QQ2-24-83" id="x24-820003.2.4">Output
          Transform (RRT and ODT)</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">The Academy also defines Output
          Transforms, the transform necessary for viewing ACES
          image data on different classes of displays. An Output
          Transform is the concatenation of two transforms. First,
          the Reference Rendering Transform (RRT) applies a local
          contrast boost and tone maps scene-referred linear
          imagery for the purposes of picture rendering. See
          Section 3.2.1.1 for a more in-depth discussion of
          transforming scene-referred linear imagery for display.
          Second, the Output Device Transform (ODT). It is used to
          provide gamut mapping and further tone mapping to the
          target output device. The RRT portion is constant across
          all displays. The ODT varies between classes of display
          devices. Output Transforms are provided for common
          display specifications such as sRGB, Rec. 709, DCI-P3,
          XYZ and ST.2084 1000, 2000 and 4000 nits.</p>
