          <p class="noindent">An RGB color encoding is defined by
          its primaries, white point and transfer functions.
          Output-referred encodings have only an Electro-Optical
          Transfer Function (EOTF) which defines the relationship
          between code value and display light. This may be defined
          relative to display peak luminance, or as an absolute
          encoding in terms of display cd/m2. Scene-referred
          encodings have only an Opto-Electrical Transfer Function
          (OETF) which defines the relationship between relative
          scene light and the encoded value. Some encodings, such
          as Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG), define a relationship to both
          scene and display light, so have both an OETF and and
          EOTF. Encoded values may be represented either as
          floating point numbers, or by integers at a specific bit
          depth. The equations given in the following sections are
          for the floating point form. Logarithmic encodings of
          image data can fit a high dynamic range into the 0-1
          range, which makes them suitable for storing in integer
          file formats or transmitting over SDI.</p>
          <p class="indent">The primaries and white points of some
          common color encodings are plotted on the CIE 1931
          chromaticity diagram above. The subsequent sections give
          more detail on the usage of each color encoding, together
          with the various encoding and decoding functions. The
          complete set of all forward and reverse encoding and
          decoding functions (an EOTF is not normally the inverse
          of the corresponding OETF, creating an Optical to Optical
          Transfer Function, or OOTF) is available in Colour
          Science for Python, together with the matrices to
          transform to CIE XYZ, referred to as the Normalized
          Primary Matrix (NPM) of a color space, and their
          inverses.</p>

          709</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">ITU-R BT.709, commonly referred to as
          Rec. 709, specifies a D65 white point and a piecewise
          transfer function. It is important to be aware that the
          transfer function given for Rec. 709 is an encoding
          function (OETF) for a video camera, not an EOTF for a
          display, making it a scene-referred encoding. It is, in
          fact, rare to find the Rec. 709 curve implemented exactly
          in any camera, as video cameras often include a ‘knee’
          for highlight compression and other user controls which
          cause the image to diverge from the standard. This means
          that it is not normally possible to accurately invert
          Rec. 709 material to scene-referred linear. Where
          necessary, ITU-R BT.2087-0 recommends the use of a simple
          square function to revert material from a Rec. 709 camera
          to scene-referred linear.</p>
          <p class="indent">The encoding function specified in Rec.
          709 is:</p>

          encoded with the Rec. 709 (BT.1886) Output Transform.
          Copyright A.M.P.A.S. The EOTF used for display of Rec.
          709 material is specified by ITU-R BT.1886, which was
          introduced later, as no EOTF was specified originally in
          Rec. 709. It is a variation on a gamma curve, intended to
          more accurately replicate the response of legacy CRT
          displays. The BT.1886 equation takes account of the black
          level of the display in use, but for display
          technologies, such as OLED, which are capable of
          producing a true black, BT.1886 becomes a pure 2.4 gamma
          power law curve. In fact, standard practice is to
          calibrate OLED displays to a non-zero black level.
          However, when encoding material for an unspecified
          BT.1886 display, where the black level is unknown, the
          norm is to use a pure 2.4 gamma, as is done in the ACES
          Rec. 709 Output Transform, for example.</p>
          <p class="indent">A BT.1886 display uses the primaries as
          defined by Rec. 709, and the following EOTF:</p>

          the encoded signal (ranged 0-1). The constants a and b
          are calculated from the target black level LB and white

          monitor, but often considerably higher for a consumer TV)

          <p class="indent">When encoding desired display
          colorimetry for BT.1886 display, where the black level of
          the display is unknown (as is always the situation when
          delivering video for a wide audience) the recommended
          approach is to use a value of zero for LB. For this
          reason, the ACES Rec. 709 Output Transform uses pure 2.4
          gamma.</p>

          encoded with the sRGB Output Transform. Copyright
          A.M.P.A.S. Due to differences in inherent display
          technologies, there is substantial variation in the
          appearance of RGB when the same code values are sent to
          multiple displays, making the unambiguous distribution of
          RGB imagery difficult. As a solution, a standard
          idealized computer display has been defined, sRGB, which
          real displays often attempt to reproduce. The intent of
          sRGB (Standard RGB) is to define the color
          characteristics of a standardized RGB display, such that
          imagery on one monitor matches the appearance of a
          different monitor. Older display technologies (such as
          CRTs) naturally approach the sRGB specification. However,
          modern technologies, such as LCD and OLED which have very
          different inherent image responses, typically provide an
          option to emulate the sRGB specification to maintain
          compatibility with existing imagery.</p>
          <p class="indent">sRGB uses the primaries and D65 white
          point specified in ITU-R BT.709, and thus can represent
          the same gamut of colors as Rec. 709.</p>
          <p class="indent">The sRGB encoding function is defined

          1.055)2.4 else: L = V / 12.92</p>
          <p class="indent">There is some debate about the EOTF to
          be used for displaying sRGB image data. Since the sRGB
          transfer function approximates 2.2 gamma, some take from
          the specification that it defines an OETF to be used when
          encoding image data for a display with 2.2 gamma, and
          that the linear portion near black exists only to
          minimize quantization error in integer implementations.
          Others contend that the sRGB decoding function should be
          used as the EOTF so that the sRGB curve can be used to
          exactly encode desired display colorimetry.</p>
          <p class="indent">Since there is no agreement on this
          matter, outside a situation where both the encoding of
          the image data and the calibration of the display are
          within your control, it is not possible to be certain of
          the exact luminance which will result on an end user’s
          sRGB display from a given encoding.</p>
          <p class="indent">The situation is complicated still
          further by viewing environment. One of the aims of the
          sRGB specification was to define a standard for display
          of video material on a computer monitor such that there
          is a perceptual match between a video monitor in its
          expected viewing environment and a computer monitor in a
          brighter environment. This would suggest that video
          images should not be modified for viewing on a sRGB
          monitor, as the necessary compensation is already built
          into the display. ACES provides separate Output
          Transforms for Rec.709 and sRGB, intended to produce the
          same display colorimetry on the two display standards.
          This is however only an appropriate approach if the two
          displays are to be viewed in the same environment.</p>

          specified by Dolby under the name PQ, for Perceptual
          Quantizer. To encode such a wide range without visible
          banding, ST.2084 requires at least 12 bit processing to
          be used in production. For delivery at least 10 bits are
          required, and although visible banding is possible at
          this bit depth, experiments by Dolby have indicated that
          noise present in real-world images makes this banding

          <p class="indent">While the output of the ST.2084 EOTF is
          defined in absolute units of cd/m2, the input to the
          function is less rigorously defined. As such, there is
          some debate as to what transform to apply to
          scene-referred linear data before converting to ST.2084.
          The most basic approach would be to simply scale the
          scene-referred linear values to set diffuse white to a
          particular display brightness and then encode with the
          inverse of the ST.2084 EOTF. However, this would make
          display light directly proportional to scene light and,
          as has been discussed in Section 2, due to the difference
          in absolute luminance and viewing environment, this will
          not normally give a perceptual match. Some form of view
          transform is usually required. This can be left to the
          colorist to add as part of the look, but a base transform
          which adds some contrast and roll-off in the highlights
          and shadows can be beneficial. It is also worth bearing
          in mind that the traditional lift, gamma, and gain
          operators are particularly unsuitable for acting on
          ST.2084 image data, where 0-1 represent zero to 10,000
          cd/m2. Highlights, in particular, can swing
          uncontrollably into extreme values as a result of small
          changes. Modern grading systems offer alternate grading
          operators tailored to the needs of HDR grading.</p>
          <p class="indent">The most universally available view
          transforms for HDR are the ACES Output Transforms.
          Versions are included for 1000, 2000, and 4000 cd/m2.
          These aim to provide an HDR image which is perceptually
          similar to the result of the ACES SDR Output Transforms,
          placing diffuse white at about 86 cd/m2, and reserving
          the higher luminances for specular highlights and
          in-frame light sources. This is in line with the original
          intent of the ST.2084 specification, which says that it
          “is intended to enable the creation of video images with
          an increased luminance range; not for the creation of
          video images with overall higher luminance levels.”
          However, as more experience has been gained with
          delivering in HDR, many people have come to feel that a
          higher level for diffuse white is preferable and that,
          particularly given the higher brightnesses of current
          consumer SDR televisions and computer displays, this
          gives a better perceptual match between SDR and HDR
          versions of the same image. ITU-R BT.2408-0 recommends
          setting diffuse white at 203 cd/m2, but acknowledges that
          it is a creative choice. This kind of exposure offset can
          be achieved in ACES as part of an HDR specific Look
          Transform which simply applies gain in linear. The
          parametric Output Transforms which form part of ACES 1.1
          include a parameter for “mid-point luminance” (18</p>
          <p class="indent">Some manufacturers implement view
          transforms for HDR in their cameras for on-set HDR
          monitoring, and provide LUTs which match those transforms
          for use in post. ARRI’s ALF-2 and RED’s IPP2 LUTs can be
          used as output transforms for LogC/ALEXA Wide Gamut and
          Log3G10/RED Wide Gamut working spaces respectively, and
          other color encodings can be transformed to those to make
          them suitable as input for the LUTs. Some grading systems
          implement these as options in their color management
          pipelines, and also offer their own proprietary view
          transforms. When using a proprietary tone mapping
          algorithm it is important to ensure that a method is
          available, usually by baking a LUT, for implementing the
          transforms in other software.</p>

          Log Gamma (HLG)</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">The ACES Still Life reference image
          encoded with the HLG Output Transform. Notice that the
          image looks “normal”, if somewhat muted on an SDR
          display. Copyright A.M.P.A.S. Hybrid Log Gamma is an
          encoding designed by the BBC in collaboration with NHK.
          It is defined as a scene referred encoding so is based on
          an OETF but also defines an EOTF to work in conjunction
          with it. When concatenated, these produce the encoding’s
          OOTF, a system gamma, which defines the relationship
          between scene light and display light. The HLG OOTF is a
          power function whose exponent is dependent on the peak
          white of the particular display. It is also, unlike most
          transfer functions, not simply applied to each RGB
          component independently, but rather it incorporates the
          luminance value, a weighted sum of the three linear
          components, in the calculation.</p>
          <p class="indent">Part of the design intent of HLG is
          that the OETF encodes a high dynamic range scene using a
          curve which is broadly similar to that which might be
          used by a traditional SDR video camera with a highlight
          compressing ‘knee’. This means that an HLG signal
          displayed on an SDR monitor, which has no way of
          interpreting the signal as HDR and simply applies a
          BT.1886 EOTF, will produce a reasonable looking image.
          Because HLG encodings normally use Rec. 2020 primaries,
          rather than Rec. 709, the image is likely to look
          somewhat desaturated, but it will be watchable. This
          backward compatibility is intended to enable HLG signals
          to be processed through legacy SDR infrastructure in
          studios and outside broadcast trucks, without all
          monitors needing to be replaced with HDR displays. In
          order to provide this kind of compatibility, it is
          recommended to set exposure so diffuse white falls at
          75</p>
          <p class="indent">Whilst HLG provides additional headroom
          for highlights by ‘emulating’ a traditional SDR camera
          knee, a large increase in dynamic range is also achieved
          by no longer using a linear part of the OETF near black.
          This is a significant difference from the SDR Rec. 709
          curve. Not having a linear portion to the OETF means that
          noise reduction in the blacks must be achieved by
          alternative processing in the camera.</p>

          describes the native primaries of a DLP projector.
          Whereas the sRGB specification uses a color encoding
          suited for the desktop environment, the DCI-P3

          The P3 primaries are wide-gamut relative to desktop

          distinctly orange-red hue, while pure P3 red is “blood”
          red, almost on the spectral locus. The DCI white point is
          not necessarily the creative white point used in
          mastering. Productions are free to master to any white
          point they prefer, provided all mastered colors fall
          within the allowed DCI gamut. Indeed, for artistic
          considerations, the DCI white point is often avoided due

          encoded with the DCDM Output Transform. On an sRGB
          display it is low contrast (due to the 2.6 gamma) and the

          interpreted as if they were RGB. Copyright A.M.P.A.S. The
          Digital Cinema Initiative (DCI) specification defines the
          standard for digital cinema mastering and theatrical
          exhibition, including colorimetry. The encoding specified
          for DCP mastering is X’Y’Z‘ (called “x-prime, y-prime,
          z-prime”). It is an output-referred, gamma 2.6 encoding
          of CIE-XYZ, with a reference white at 48cd/m2. As the
          X’Y’Z’ coding space spans an area larger than the visual
          gamut, the minimum display gamut specified by DCI is that
          of P3.</p>
          <p class="indent">The intent of the X’Y’Z’ coding space
          is display-referred, such that the full-color appearance
          of the theatrical imagery, such as any film emulation 3D
          LUTs, are fully baked into the X’Y’Z’ image. Therefore,
          an image in X’Y’Z’ is completely unambiguous; there
          should be essentially no color variation between properly
          calibrated theatrical digital projectors. The DCI
          specification chose a gamma 2.6 encoding after a series
          of perceptual experiments using “golden-eye observers” to
          maximize the bit-depth fidelity under theatrical viewing
          conditions. DCI specifies 12 bits per channel, which is
          intended to prevent banding artifacts under even the most
          trying conditions. DCI also specifies a series of color
          patches which are useful in calibration. (Please refer to
          the DCI specification for additional details.) X’Y’Z’
          files are encoded using JPEG-2000 compression, which is a
          lossy, wavelet compression codec. No inter-frame
          compression is used, which allows for both forward and
          backward scrubbing. The DCI specification also defines
          two resolutions known as “2K” and “4K”. The 2K raster is
          2048x1080 and the 4K raster is 4096x2160. DCI compliant
          films must fill at least one of these axes. Material with
          an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 - “flat” - is typically
          delivered for a 2K release at 1998x1080, and 2.39:1 -
          “scope” - is delivered for a 2K release at 2048x858. For
          4K release, double these sizes. DCP encoders accept 16
          bit tiffs, so the convention is to utilize the full 16
          bit coding range of 0-65535, and then to let the
          compressor just use the high order 12 bits.</p>

          SLog</a></h4>
          <p class="noindent">Sony has offered a range of encoding
          curves in their cameras, with the latest being S-Log3.
          The original S-Log is now deprecated, and not something
          likely to be seen on current productions. S-Log2 and
          S-Log3 are still both current. S-Log2 is normally paired
          with S-Gamut primaries, whereas S-Log3 may be paired
          either with S-Gamut3 or S-Gamut3.Cine primaries. S-Gamut
          and S-Gamut3 use the same wide gamut primaries; it is
          simply that the matrices used in the camera to transform
          to them from the sensor native color space are different.
          As has been mentioned previously in Section 3.3.1, a 3x3
          camera matrix can only ever be an approximation of the
          ideal transform to set of encoding primaries. S-Gamut and
          S-Gamut3 use different optimizations. S-Gamut3 has the
          additional advantage that the transform to ACES is the
          same at all color temperatures, whereas for S-Gamut, two
          Input Transforms are provided by Sony for use under
          tungsten and daylight. S-Gamut3.Cine is slightly less
          wide gamut than S-Gamut3, and was designed to be more
          closely aligned with P3 primaries, making manual grading
          to P3 simpler. In a scene-referred workflow there is no
          benefit to this, and indeed recording in S-Gamut3.Cine
          will clip some colors which may be present in the scene,
          compared to S-Gamut3. Nonetheless, many people use
          S-Gamut3.Cine as the default camera setting, so it is
          important to ascertain which was used. As with Canon
          footage, using Sony’s own software can be a useful way of
          reading metadata from the files which might not otherwise
          be available. Some Sony cameras also include XML files
          with the media, which can provide useful information.</p>

          <p class="noindent">ACEScc is a logarithmic variant of
          the ACES color space for use in grading. It is a pure log
          curve, so each stop change of exposure is represented by
          an equal offset of the ACEScc value throughout the range.
          It uses AP1 primaries, which are the same as those used
          by ACEScg. Being a pure log curve, ACEScc cannot encode
          negative values (although the ACES spec asks that
          implementers provide some means of handling negative
          values in order to preserve them through a transform to
          ACEScc and back). It encodes a very wide dynamic range,
          with 1.0 representing a linear value of 222.86, or 10.27

          <p class="noindent">ACEScct is a variation on ACEScc,
          which is identical through most of the curve but adds a
          linear portion near black to create a toe, and to allow
          for the encoding of negative values. Because the toe of
          the resulting curve makes it more similar to camera log
          encodings than the pure log of ACEScc, it responds in a
          more comparable way to grading operations.</p>

          <p class="noindent">The Cineon log encoding differs from
          digital motion-picture camera log encodings in that
          Cineon is a logarithmic encoding of the actual optical
          density of the film negative. The non-linearities and
          cross-channel effects of film mean that there are no CIE
          xy values which can be said to be the primaries of a
          Cineon encoding. This means that there is not one formula
          which precisely reverts Cineon film scans to
          scene-referred linear. Various functions are proposed for
          linearising film scans.</p>
